## Safety

We acknowledge the dangers a political advisory tool can have. LLMs are proven to halucinate, show bias or also deliver wrong sources.

We decided to be fully transparent to provide a basis of trust in this uncertain realm of AI application and societal acceptance.

​
With Wahl-O-Smart we have developed a election tool with an AI chatbot integration and are deeply conscious of the ethical implications this entails. Recognizing the potential risks, such as misinformation and bias, inherent in AI technologies, we are committed to transparency and responsibility. Here’s how we're approaching this:

​

* **Transparency:** We Open Source everything

* **Accuracy and Fairness:** Advanced RAG-Pipeline for frontier source accuracy and LLM rule checkers for fairness maximization

* **Ethical Engagement:** We supervised the preferred sources by political experts and openly take part in the global discussion around AI Safety and Alignment

​

In navigating the intersection of technology and democracy, Wahl-O-Mat pledges to uphold the highest standards, ensuring our AI tools enhance informed opinion building, decision making, decrease political apathy and make the existing tools shorter as well as more accessibale.
