The image is a page from a report, titled "Summary for Policymakers". The page is divided into two main sections, with text and tables presenting information about greenhouse gas (GHG) and CO2 emissions reductions for certain temperature goal scenarios. The page number at the bottom is 21.

At the top, there is Table SPM.3 titled "Greenhouse gas and CO2 emission reductions from 2019 and % reductions (percent) at 1.5°C, 2°C & higher 2°C (ref 26, 34-36)". The table is further divided into sub-headers: "Limit warming to 1.5°C (>50% with no or low overshoot)", "Limit warming to 2°C (>67% probability)", and "Higher 2°C scenarios (50-67% probability)". Each sub-header has three columns beneath it labeled "GHG", "CO2 (fossil and industry)", and "CO2 (fossil, industry & land use)". Under these sub-headers and columns, there are the following rows with data for the year 2030:

| Limit warming to 1.5°C (>50% with no or low overshoot) | Limit warming to 2°C (>67% probability) | Higher 2°C scenarios (50-67% probability) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GHG | CO2 (fossil and industry) | CO2 (fossil, industry & land use) | GHG | CO2 (fossil and industry) | CO2 (fossil, industry & land use) | GHG | CO2 (fossil and industry) | CO2 (fossil, industry & land use) |
| -43% | -45% | -59% | -25% | -30% | -56% | -20% | -20% | -53% |

The row indicates percentage reductions for each component required by the year 2030 to achieve the specified temperature goals.

Below the table, there is text split into three sections, each identified with a numbered title:

1. "6.3 Limiting warming to specific levels involves limiting cumulative CO2 emissions... 
There is a footnote indicated with the number 36.

2. "6.4 Migration towards sustainable pathways..."
There are key bullets under this section that conclude with a note. However, the latter part of the text and the note is cut off at the bottom of the page.

3. "6.5 Effective implementation... 
Again, this section is incomplete and ends abruptly.

Throughout the text, there are several references like "(ref 23)" or "(ref 36)" denoting specific references not visible in the image. Moreover, the bottom of the page contains a citation reference and a statement regarding the importance of context in the interpretation and application of these findings.
