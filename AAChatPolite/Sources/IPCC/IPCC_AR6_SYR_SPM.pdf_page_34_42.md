and afforestation. WASH refers to water, sanitation and hygiene. Six feasibility dimensions (economic, technological, institutional, social, environmental and 
geophysical) were used to calculate the potential feasibility of climate responses and adaptation options, along with their synergies with mitigation. For 
potential feasibility and feasibility dimensions, the figure shows high, medium, or low feasibility. Synergies with mitigation are identified as high, medium, and 
low. The right-hand side of Panel a provides an overview of selected mitigation options and their estimated costs and potentials in 2030. Costs are net lifetime 
discounted monetary costs of avoided GHG emissions calculated relative to a reference technology. Relative potentials and costs will vary by place, context and 
time and in the longer term compared to 2030. The potential (horizontal axis) is the net GHG emission reduction (sum of reduced emissions and/or enhanced 
sinks) broken down into cost categories (coloured bar segments) relative to an emission baseline consisting of current policy (around 2019) reference scenarios 
from the AR6 scenarios database. The potentials are assessed independently for each option and are not additive. Health system mitigation options are included 
mostly in settlement and infrastructure (e.g., efficient healthcare buildings) and cannot be identified separately. Fuel switching in industry refers to switching 
to electricity, hydrogen, bioenergy and natural gas. Gradual colour transitions indicate uncertain breakdown into cost categories due to uncertainty or heavy 
context dependency. The uncertainty in the total potential is typically 25–50%. Panel (b) displays the indicative potential of demand-side mitigation options 
for 2050. Potentials are estimated based on approximately 500 bottom-up studies representing all global regions. The baseline (white bar) is provided by the 
sectoral mean GHG emissions in 2050 of the two scenarios (IEA-STEPS and IP_ModAct) consistent with policies announced by national governments until 2020. 
The green arrow represents the demand-side emissions reductions potentials. The range in potential is shown by a line connecting dots displaying the highest 
and the lowest potentials reported in the literature. Food shows demand-side potential of socio-cultural factors and infrastructure use, and changes in land-use 
patterns enabled by change in food demand. Demand-side measures and new ways of end-use service provision can reduce global GHG emissions in end-use 
sectors (buildings, land transport, food) by 40–70% by 2050 compared to baseline scenarios, while some regions and socioeconomic groups require additional 
energy and resources. The last row shows how demand-side mitigation options in other sectors can influence overall electricity demand. The dark grey bar shows 
the projected increase in electricity demand above the 2050 baseline due to increasing electrification in the other sectors. Based on a bottom-up assessment, 
this projected increase in electricity demand can be avoided through demand-side mitigation options in the domains of infrastructure use and socio-cultural 
factors that influence electricity usage in industry, land transport, and buildings (green arrow). {Figure 4.4} 
Mitigation and Adaptation Options across Systems 
C.3 
Rapid and far-reaching transitions across all sectors and systems are necessary to achieve 
deep and sustained emissions reductions and secure a liveable and sustainable future for all. 
These system transitions involve a significant upscaling of a wide portfolio of mitigation and 
adaptation options. Feasible, effective, and low-cost options for mitigation and adaptation 
are already available, with differences across systems and regions. (high confidence) {4.1, 4.5, 
4.6} (Figure SPM.7)
C.3.1 The systemic change required to achieve rapid and deep emissions reductions and transformative adaptation to climate 
change is unprecedented in terms of scale, but not necessarily in terms of speed (medium confidence). Systems transitions 
include: deployment of low- or zero-emission technologies; reducing and changing demand through infrastructure 
design and access, socio-cultural and behavioural changes, and increased technological efficiency and adoption; social 
protection, climate services or other services; and protecting and restoring ecosystems (high confidence). Feasible, 
effective, and low-cost options for mitigation and adaptation are already available (high confidence). The availability, 
feasibility and potential of mitigation and adaptation options in the near term differs across systems and regions (very 
high confidence). {4.1, 4.5.1 to 4.5.6} (Figure SPM.7)
Energy Systems 
C.3.2	 Net zero CO2 energy systems entail: a substantial reduction in overall fossil fuel use, minimal use of unabated fossil 
fuels51, and use of carbon capture and storage in the remaining fossil fuel systems; electricity systems that emit no 
net CO2; widespread electrification; alternative energy carriers in applications less amenable to electrification; energy 
conservation and efficiency; and greater integration across the energy system (high confidence). Large contributions 
to emissions reductions with costs less than USD 20 tCO2-eq-1 come from solar and wind energy, energy efficiency 
improvements, and methane emissions reductions (coal mining, oil and gas, waste) (medium confidence). There are 
feasible adaptation options that support infrastructure resilience, reliable power systems and efficient water use for 
existing and new energy generation systems (very high confidence). Energy generation diversification (e.g., via wind, 
solar, small scale hydropower) and demand-side management (e.g., storage and energy efficiency improvements) can 
increase energy reliability and reduce vulnerabilities to climate change (high confidence). Climate responsive energy 
markets, updated design standards on energy assets according to current and projected climate change, smart-grid 
technologies, robust transmission systems and improved capacity to respond to supply deficits have high feasibility in 
the medium to long term, with mitigation co-benefits (very high confidence). {4.5.1} (Figure SPM.7)

In this context, ‘unabated fossil fuels’ refers to fossil fuels produced and used without interventions that substantially reduce the amount of GHG emitted 
throughout the life cycle; for example, capturing 90% or more CO2 from power plants, or 50–80% of fugitive methane emissions from energy supply.
