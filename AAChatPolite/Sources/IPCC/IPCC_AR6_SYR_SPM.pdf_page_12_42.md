Summary for Policymakers
A.2.4	 Climate change has reduced food security and affected water security, hindering efforts to meet Sustainable 
Development Goals (high confidence). Although overall agricultural productivity has increased, climate change has 
slowed this growth over the past 50 years globally (medium confidence), with related negative impacts mainly in mid- 
and low latitude regions but positive impacts in some high latitude regions (high confidence). Ocean warming and 
ocean acidification have adversely affected food production from fisheries and shellfish aquaculture in some oceanic 
regions (high confidence). Roughly half of the world’s population currently experience severe water scarcity for at least 
part of the year due to a combination of climatic and non-climatic drivers (medium confidence). {2.1.2, Figure 2.3} 
(Figure SPM.1)
A.2.5	 In all regions increases in extreme heat events have resulted in human mortality and morbidity (very high confidence). 
The occurrence of climate-related food-borne and water-borne diseases (very high confidence) and the incidence 
of vector-borne diseases (high confidence) have increased. In assessed regions, some mental health challenges are 
associated with increasing temperatures (high confidence), trauma from extreme events (very high confidence), and 
loss of livelihoods and culture (high confidence). Climate and weather extremes are increasingly driving displacement 
in Africa, Asia, North America (high confidence), and Central and South America (medium confidence), with small island 
states in the Caribbean and South Pacific being disproportionately affected relative to their small population size (high 
confidence). {2.1.2, Figure 2.3} (Figure SPM.1) 
A.2.6	 Climate change has caused widespread adverse impacts and related losses and damages13 to nature and people that are 
unequally distributed across systems, regions and sectors. Economic damages from climate change have been detected 
in climate-exposed sectors, such as agriculture, forestry, fishery, energy, and tourism. Individual livelihoods have been 
affected through, for example, destruction of homes and infrastructure, and loss of property and income, human health 
and food security, with adverse effects on gender and social equity. (high confidence) {2.1.2} (Figure SPM.1)
A.2.7	 In urban areas, observed climate change has caused adverse impacts on human health, livelihoods and key infrastructure. 
Hot extremes have intensified in cities. Urban infrastructure, including transportation, water, sanitation and energy 
systems have been compromised by extreme and slow-onset events14, with resulting economic losses, disruptions of 
services and negative impacts to well-being. Observed adverse impacts are concentrated amongst economically and 
socially marginalised urban residents. (high confidence) {2.1.2}
13	
In this report, the term ‘losses and damages’ refers to adverse observed impacts and/or projected risks and can be economic and/or non-economic (see 
Annex I: Glossary).
14	
Slow-onset events are described among the climatic-impact drivers of the AR6 WGI and refer to the risks and impacts associated with e.g., increasing 
temperature means, desertification, decreasing precipitation, loss of biodiversity, land and forest degradation, glacial retreat and related impacts, ocean 
acidification, sea level rise and salinization. {2.1.2}
