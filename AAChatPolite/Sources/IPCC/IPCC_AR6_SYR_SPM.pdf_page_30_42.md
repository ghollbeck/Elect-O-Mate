C. Responses in the Near Term 
Urgency of Near-Term Integrated Climate Action 
C.1	
Climate change is a threat to human well-being and planetary health (very high confidence). 
There is a rapidly closing window of opportunity to secure a liveable and sustainable future for 
all (very high confidence). Climate resilient development integrates adaptation and mitigation 
to advance sustainable development for all, and is enabled by increased international 
cooperation including improved access to adequate financial resources, particularly for 
vulnerable regions, sectors and groups, and inclusive governance and coordinated policies 
(high confidence). The choices and actions implemented in this decade will have impacts now 
and for thousands of years (high confidence). {3.1, 3.3, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.7, 4.8, 4.9, Figure 3.1, 
Figure 3.3, Figure 4.2} (Figure SPM.1, Figure SPM.6)
C.1.1	 Evidence of observed adverse impacts and related losses and damages, projected risks, levels and trends in vulnerability 
and adaptation limits, demonstrate that worldwide climate resilient development action is more urgent than previously 
assessed in AR5. Climate resilient development integrates adaptation and GHG mitigation to advance sustainable 
development for all. Climate resilient development pathways have been constrained by past development, emissions 
and climate change and are progressively constrained by every increment of warming, in particular beyond 1.5Â°C. 
(very high confidence) {3.4, 3.4.2, 4.1}
C.1.2	 Government actions at sub-national, national and international levels, with civil society and the private sector, play a 
crucial role in enabling and accelerating shifts in development pathways towards sustainability and climate resilient 
development (very high confidence). Climate resilient development is enabled when governments, civil society and 
the private sector make inclusive development choices that prioritize risk reduction, equity and justice, and when 
decision-making processes, finance and actions are integrated across governance levels, sectors, and timeframes (very 
high confidence). Enabling conditions are differentiated by national, regional and local circumstances and geographies, 
according to capabilities, and include: political commitment and follow-through, coordinated policies, social and 
international cooperation, ecosystem stewardship, inclusive governance, knowledge diversity, technological innovation, 
monitoring and evaluation, and improved access to adequate financial resources, especially for vulnerable regions, 
sectors and communities (high confidence). {3.4, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.7, 4.8} (Figure SPM.6)
C.1.3	 Continued emissions will further affect all major climate system components, and many changes will be irreversible on 
centennial to millennial time scales and become larger with increasing global warming. Without urgent, effective, and 
equitable mitigation and adaptation actions, climate change increasingly threatens ecosystems, biodiversity, and the 
livelihoods, health and well-being of current and future generations. (high confidence) {3.1.3, 3.3.3, 3.4.1, Figure 3.4,
