Annual wettest day precipitation is projected to increase 
in almost all continental regions, even in regions where 
projected annual mean soil moisture declines.
Annual hottest day temperature is projected to increase most 
(1.5-2 times the GWL) in some mid-latitude and semi-arid 
regions, and in the South American Monsoon region.
Projections of annual mean soil moisture largely follow 
projections in annual mean precipitation but also show 
some differences due to the inﬂuence of evapotranspiration.

With every increment of global warming, regional changes in mean 
climate and extremes become more widespread and pronounced
Figure SPM.2: Projected changes of annual maximum daily maximum temperature, annual mean total column soil moisture and annual 
maximum 1-day precipitation at global warming levels of 1.5°C, 2°C, 3°C, and 4°C relative to 1850–1900. Projected (a) annual maximum 
daily temperature change (°C), (b) annual mean total column soil moisture change (standard deviation), (c) annual maximum 1-day precipitation change (%). 
The panels show CMIP6 multi-model median changes. In panels (b) and (c), large positive relative changes in dry regions may correspond to small absolute 
changes. In panel (b), the unit is the standard deviation of interannual variability in soil moisture during 1850–1900. Standard deviation is a widely used 
metric in characterising drought severity. A projected reduction in mean soil moisture by one standard deviation corresponds to soil moisture conditions typical 
of droughts that occurred about once every six years during 1850–1900. The WGI Interactive Atlas (https://interactive-atlas.ipcc.ch/) can be used to explore 
additional changes in the climate system across the range of global warming levels presented in this figure. {Figure 3.1, Cross-Section Box.2}
Climate Change Impacts and Climate-Related Risks
B.2	
For any given future warming level, many climate-related risks are higher than assessed in 
AR5, and projected long-term impacts are up to multiple times higher than currently observed 
(high confidence). Risks and projected adverse impacts and related losses and damages from 
climate change escalate with every increment of global warming (very high confidence). 
Climatic and non-climatic risks will increasingly interact, creating compound and cascading 
risks that are more complex and difficult to manage (high confidence). {Cross-Section Box.2,
