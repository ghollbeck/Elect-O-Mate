B. Future Climate Change, Risks, and Long-Term Responses
Future Climate Change 
B.1	
Continued greenhouse gas emissions will lead to increasing global warming, with the best 
estimate of reaching 1.5°C in the near term in considered scenarios and modelled pathways. 
Every increment of global warming will intensify multiple and concurrent hazards (high 
confidence). Deep, rapid, and sustained reductions in greenhouse gas emissions would 
lead to a discernible slowdown in global warming within around two decades, and also 
to discernible changes in atmospheric composition within a few years (high confidence).

B.1.1	
Global warming28 will continue to increase in the near term (2021–2040) mainly due to increased cumulative 
CO2 emissions in nearly all considered scenarios and modelled pathways. In the near term, global warming is more 
likely than not to reach 1.5°C even under the very low GHG emission scenario (SSP1-1.9) and likely or very likely to 
exceed 1.5°C under higher emissions scenarios. In the considered scenarios and modelled pathways, the best estimates 
of the time when the level of global warming of 1.5°C is reached lie in the near term29. Global warming declines back 
to below 1.5°C by the end of the 21st century in some scenarios and modelled pathways (see B.7). The assessed 
climate response to GHG emissions scenarios results in a best estimate of warming for 2081–2100 that spans a range 
from 1.4°C for a very low GHG emissions scenario (SSP1-1.9) to 2.7°C for an intermediate GHG emissions scenario 
(SSP2-4.5) and 4.4°C for a very high GHG emissions scenario (SSP5-8.5)30, with narrower uncertainty ranges31 than for 
corresponding scenarios in AR5. {Cross-Section Boxes 1 and 2, 3.1.1, 3.3.4, Table 3.1, 4.3} (Box SPM.1)
B.1.2	
Discernible differences in trends of global surface temperature between contrasting GHG emissions scenarios (SSP1-1.9 
and SSP1-2.6 vs. SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5) would begin to emerge from natural variability32 within around 20 years. Under 
these contrasting scenarios, discernible effects would emerge within years for GHG concentrations, and sooner for air 
quality improvements, due to the combined targeted air pollution controls and strong and sustained methane emissions 
reductions.  Targeted reductions of air pollutant emissions lead to more rapid improvements in air quality within years 
compared to reductions in GHG emissions only, but in the long term, further improvements are projected in scenarios 
that combine efforts to reduce air pollutants as well as GHG emissions33. (high confidence) {3.1.1} (Box SPM.1)
B.1.3	
Continued emissions will further affect all major climate system components. With every additional increment of global 
warming, changes in extremes continue to become larger. Continued global warming is projected to further intensify 
the global water cycle, including its variability, global monsoon precipitation, and very wet and very dry weather and

Global warming (see Annex I: Glossary) is here reported as running 20-year averages, unless stated otherwise, relative to 1850–1900. Global surface 
temperature in any single year can vary above or below the long-term human-caused trend, due to natural variability. The internal variability of global 
surface temperature in a single year is estimated to be about ±0.25°C (5–95% range, high confidence). The occurrence of individual years with global 
surface temperature change above a certain level does not imply that this global warming level has been reached. {4.3, Cross-Section Box.2}
29	
Median five-year interval at which a 1.5°C global warming level is reached (50% probability) in categories of modelled pathways considered in WGIII is 
2030–2035. By 2030, global surface temperature in any individual year could exceed 1.5°C relative to 1850–1900 with a probability between 40% and 
60%, across the five scenarios assessed in WGI (medium confidence). In all scenarios considered in WGI except the very high emissions scenario (SSP5-8.5), 
the midpoint of the first 20-year running average period during which the assessed average global surface temperature change reaches 1.5°C lies in the 
first half of the 2030s. In the very high GHG emissions scenario, the midpoint is in the late 2020s. {3.1.1, 3.3.1, 4.3} (Box SPM.1)

The best estimates [and very likely ranges] for the different scenarios are: 1.4 [1.0 to 1.8 ]°C (SSP1-1.9); 1.8 [1.3 to 2.4]°C (SSP1-2.6); 2.7 [2.1 to 3.5]°C 
(SSP2-4.5); 3.6 [2.8 to 4.6]°C (SSP3-7.0); and 4.4 [3.3 to 5.7 ]°C (SSP5-8.5). {3.1.1} (Box SPM.1)
31	
Assessed future changes in global surface temperature have been constructed, for the first time, by combining multi-model projections with observational 
constraints and the assessed equilibrium climate sensitivity and transient climate response. The uncertainty range is narrower than in the AR5 thanks to 
improved knowledge of climate processes, paleoclimate evidence and model-based emergent constraints. {3.1.1}

See Annex I: Glossary. Natural variability includes natural drivers and internal variability. The main internal variability phenomena include El Niño-Southern 
Oscillation, Pacific Decadal Variability and Atlantic Multi-decadal Variability. {4.3}
