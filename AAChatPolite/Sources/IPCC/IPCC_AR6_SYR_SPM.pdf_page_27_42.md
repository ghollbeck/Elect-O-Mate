Reaching net zero CO2 or GHG emissions primarily requires deep and rapid reductions in gross emissions of CO2, as 
well as substantial reductions of non-CO2 GHG emissions (high confidence). For example, in modelled pathways that 
limit warming to 1.5°C (>50%) with no or limited overshoot, global methane emissions are reduced by 34 [21–57] % 
by 2030 relative to 2019. However, some hard-to-abate residual GHG emissions (e.g., some emissions from agriculture, 
aviation, shipping, and industrial processes) remain and would need to be counterbalanced by deployment of CDR 
methods to achieve net zero CO2 or GHG emissions (high confidence). As a result, net zero CO2 is reached earlier than 
net zero GHGs (high confidence). {3.3.2, 3.3.3, Table 3.1, Figure 3.5} (Figure SPM.5)
B.6.3	
Global modelled mitigation pathways reaching net zero CO2 and GHG emissions include transitioning from fossil fuels 
without carbon capture and storage (CCS) to very low- or zero-carbon energy sources, such as renewables or fossil fuels 
with CCS, demand-side measures and improving efficiency, reducing non-CO2 GHG emissions, and CDR47. In most global 
modelled pathways, land-use change and forestry (via reforestation and reduced deforestation) and the energy supply 
sector reach net zero CO2 emissions earlier than the buildings, industry and transport sectors. (high confidence) {3.3.3, 
4.1, 4.5, Figure 4.1} (Figure SPM.5, Box SPM.1)
B.6.4	
Mitigation options often have synergies with other aspects of sustainable development, but some options can also 
have trade-offs. There are potential synergies between sustainable development and, for instance, energy efficiency 
and renewable energy. Similarly, depending on the context48, biological CDR methods like reforestation, improved 
forest management, soil carbon sequestration, peatland restoration and coastal blue carbon management can enhance 
biodiversity and ecosystem functions, employment and local livelihoods. However, afforestation or production of 
biomass crops can have adverse socio-economic and environmental impacts, including on biodiversity, food and water 
security, local livelihoods and the rights of Indigenous Peoples, especially if implemented at large scales and where land 
tenure is insecure. Modelled pathways that assume using resources more efficiently or that shift global development 
towards sustainability include fewer challenges, such as less dependence on CDR and pressure on land and biodiversity.

CCS is an option to reduce emissions from large-scale fossil-based energy and industry sources provided geological storage is available. When CO2 is 
captured directly from the atmosphere (DACCS), or from biomass (BECCS), CCS provides the storage component of these CDR methods. CO2 capture and 
subsurface injection is a mature technology for gas processing and enhanced oil recovery. In contrast to the oil and gas sector, CCS is less mature in the 
power sector, as well as in cement and chemicals production, where it is a critical mitigation option. The technical geological storage capacity is estimated 
to be on the order of 1000 GtCO2, which is more than the CO2 storage requirements through 2100 to limit global warming to 1.5°C, although the regional 
availability of geological storage could be a limiting factor. If the geological storage site is appropriately selected and managed, it is estimated that the CO2 
can be permanently isolated from the atmosphere. Implementation of CCS currently faces technological, economic, institutional, ecological-environmental 
and socio-cultural barriers. Currently, global rates of CCS deployment are far below those in modelled pathways limiting global warming to 1.5°C to 2°C. 
Enabling conditions such as policy instruments, greater public support and technological innovation could reduce these barriers. (high confidence) {3.3.3}

The impacts, risks, and co-benefits of CDR deployment for ecosystems, biodiversity and people will be highly variable depending on the method, site-specific 
context, implementation and scale (high confidence).
