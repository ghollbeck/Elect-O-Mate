Summary for Policymakers
Summary for Policymakers
ocean ecosystems, together with targeted management to adapt to unavoidable impacts of climate change reduces 
the vulnerability of biodiversity and ecosystem services to climate change (high confidence), reduces coastal erosion 
and flooding (high confidence), and could increase carbon uptake and storage if global warming is limited (medium 
confidence). Rebuilding overexploited or depleted fisheries reduces negative climate change impacts on fisheries 
(medium confidence) and supports food security, biodiversity, human health and well-being (high confidence). Land 
restoration contributes to climate change mitigation and adaptation with synergies via enhanced ecosystem services 
and with economically positive returns and co-benefits for poverty reduction and improved livelihoods (high confidence). 
Cooperation, and inclusive decision making, with Indigenous Peoples and local communities, as well as recognition of 
inherent rights of Indigenous Peoples, is integral to successful adaptation and mitigation across forests and other 
ecosystems (high confidence). {4.5.4, 4.6} (Figure SPM.7)
Health and Nutrition
C.3.7	 Human health will benefit from integrated mitigation and adaptation options that mainstream health into food, 
infrastructure, social protection, and water policies (very high confidence). Effective adaptation options exist to help 
protect human health and well-being, including: strengthening public health programs related to climate-sensitive 
diseases, increasing health systems resilience, improving ecosystem health, improving access to potable water, 
reducing exposure of water and sanitation systems to flooding, improving surveillance and early warning systems, 
vaccine development (very high confidence), improving access to mental healthcare, and Heat Health Action Plans that 
include early warning and response systems (high confidence). Adaptation strategies which reduce food loss and waste 
or support balanced, sustainable healthy diets contribute to nutrition, health, biodiversity and other environmental 
benefits (high confidence). {4.5.5} (Figure SPM.7) 
Society, Livelihoods, and Economies
 C.3.8	 Policy mixes that include weather and health insurance, social protection and adaptive social safety nets, contingent 
finance and reserve funds, and universal access to early warning systems combined with effective contingency plans, can 
reduce vulnerability and exposure of human systems. Disaster risk management, early warning systems, climate services 
and risk spreading and sharing approaches have broad applicability across sectors. Increasing education including 
capacity building, climate literacy, and information provided through climate services and community approaches can 
facilitate heightened risk perception and accelerate behavioural changes and planning. (high confidence) {4.5.6}
Synergies and Trade-Offs with Sustainable Development 
C.4	
Accelerated and equitable action in mitigating and adapting to climate change impacts is 
critical to sustainable development. Mitigation and adaptation actions have more synergies 
than trade-offs with Sustainable Development Goals. Synergies and trade-offs depend on 
context and scale of implementation. (high confidence) {3.4, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.6, 4.9, Figure 4.5}
C.4.1	 Mitigation efforts embedded within the wider development context can increase the pace, depth and breadth of emission 
reductions (medium confidence). Countries at all stages of economic development seek to improve the well-being of 
people, and their development priorities reflect different starting points and contexts. Different contexts include but 
are not limited to social, economic, environmental, cultural, political circumstances, resource endowment, capabilities, 
international environment, and prior development (high confidence). In regions with high dependency on fossil fuels for, 
among other things, revenue and employment generation, mitigating risk for sustainable development requires policies 
that promote economic and energy sector diversification and considerations of just transitions principles, processes 
and practices (high confidence). Eradicating extreme poverty, energy poverty, and providing decent living standards in 
low-emitting countries / regions in the context of achieving sustainable development objectives, in the near term, can 
be achieved without significant global emissions growth (high confidence). {4.4, 4.6, Annex I: Glossary}
C.4.2	 Many mitigation and adaptation actions have multiple synergies with Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and 
sustainable development generally, but some actions can also have trade-offs. Potential synergies with SDGs exceed 
potential trade-offs; synergies and trade-offs depend on the pace and magnitude of change and the development 
context including inequalities with consideration of climate justice. Trade-offs can be evaluated and minimised by 
giving emphasis to capacity building, finance, governance, technology transfer, investments, development, context 
specific gender-based and other social equity considerations with meaningful participation of Indigenous Peoples, local 
communities and vulnerable populations. (high confidence) {3.4.1, 4.6, Figure 4.5, 4.9}
