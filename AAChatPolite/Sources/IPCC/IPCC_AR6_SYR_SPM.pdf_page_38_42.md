Governance and Policies 
C.6	
Effective climate action is enabled by political commitment, well-aligned multilevel 
governance, institutional frameworks, laws, policies and strategies and enhanced access 
to finance and technology. Clear goals, coordination across multiple policy domains, and 
inclusive governance processes facilitate effective climate action. Regulatory and economic 
instruments can support deep emissions reductions and climate resilience if scaled up and 
applied widely. Climate resilient development benefits from drawing on diverse knowledge. 
(high confidence) {2.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.7}
C.6.1	 Effective climate governance enables mitigation and adaptation. Effective governance provides overall direction on 
setting targets and priorities and mainstreaming climate action across policy domains and levels, based on national 
circumstances and in the context of international cooperation. It enhances monitoring and evaluation and regulatory 
certainty, prioritising inclusive, transparent and equitable decision-making, and improves access to finance and 
technology (see C.7). (high confidence) {2.2.2, 4.7}
C.6.2	 Effective local, municipal, national and subnational institutions build consensus for climate action among diverse 
interests, enable coordination and inform strategy setting but require adequate institutional capacity. Policy support is 
influenced by actors in civil society, including businesses, youth, women, labour, media, Indigenous Peoples, and local 
communities. Effectiveness is enhanced by political commitment and partnerships between different groups in society. 
(high confidence) {2.2, 4.7}
C.6.3	 Effective multilevel governence for mitigation, adaptation, risk management, and climate resilient development is 
enabled by inclusive decision processes that prioritise equity and justice in planning and implementation, allocation of 
appropriate resources, institutional review, and monitoring and evaluation. Vulnerabilities and climate risks are often 
reduced through carefully designed and implemented laws, policies, participatory processes, and interventions that 
address context specific inequities such as those based on gender, ethnicity, disability, age, location and income. (high 
confidence) {4.4, 4.7}
C.6.4 	 Regulatory and economic instruments could support deep emissions reductions if scaled up and applied more widely 
(high confidence). Scaling up and enhancing the use of regulatory instruments can improve mitigation outcomes in 
sectoral applications, consistent with national circumstances (high confidence). Where implemented, carbon pricing 
instruments have incentivized low-cost emissions reduction measures but have been less effective, on their own and 
at prevailing prices during the assessment period, to promote higher-cost measures necessary for further reductions 
(medium confidence). Equity and distributional impacts of such carbon pricing instruments, e.g., carbon taxes and 
emissions trading, can be addressed by using revenue to support low-income households, among other approaches. 
Removing fossil fuel subsidies would reduce emissions54 and yield benefits such as improved public revenue, 
macroeconomic and sustainability performance; subsidy removal can have adverse distributional impacts, especially 
on the most economically vulnerable groups which, in some cases can be mitigated by measures such as redistributing 
revenue saved, all of which depend on national circumstances (high confidence). Economy-wide policy packages, such 
as public spending commitments and pricing reforms, can meet short-term economic goals while reducing emissions and 
shifting development pathways towards sustainability (medium confidence). Effective policy packages would be comprehensive, 
consistent, balanced across objectives, and tailored to national circumstances (high confidence). {2.2.2, 4.7}
C.6.5	 Drawing on diverse knowledges and cultural values, meaningful participation and inclusive engagement processes—
including Indigenous Knowledge, local knowledge, and scientific knowledge—facilitates climate resilient development, 
builds capacity and allows locally appropriate and socially acceptable solutions. (high confidence) {4.4, 4.5.6, 4.7}

Fossil fuel subsidy removal is projected by various studies to reduce global CO2 emission by 1 to 4%, and GHG emissions by up to 10% by 2030, varying 
across regions (medium confidence).
