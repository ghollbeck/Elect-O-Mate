Summary for Policymakers
Figure SPM.6: The illustrative development pathways (red to green) and associated outcomes (right panel) show that there is a rapidly narrowing window 
of opportunity to secure a liveable and sustainable future for all. Climate resilient development is the process of implementing greenhouse gas mitigation and 
adaptation measures to support sustainable development. Diverging pathways illustrate that interacting choices and actions made by diverse government, 
private sector and civil society actors can advance climate resilient development, shift pathways towards sustainability, and enable lower emissions and 
adaptation. Diverse knowledge and values include cultural values, Indigenous Knowledge, local knowledge, and scientific knowledge. Climatic and non-climatic 
events, such as droughts, floods or pandemics, pose more severe shocks to pathways with lower climate resilient development (red to yellow) than to pathways 
with higher climate resilient development (green). There are limits to adaptation and adaptive capacity for some human and natural systems at global warming 
of 1.5°C, and with every increment of warming, losses and damages will increase. The development pathways taken by countries at all stages of economic 
development impact GHG emissions and mitigation challenges and opportunities, which vary across countries and regions. Pathways and opportunities for 
action are shaped by previous actions (or inactions and opportunities missed; dashed pathway) and enabling and constraining conditions (left panel), and 
take place in the context of climate risks, adaptation limits and development gaps. The longer emissions reductions are delayed, the fewer effective adaptation 
options. {Figure 4.2, 3.1, 3.2, 3.4, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.6, 4.9}
The Benefits of Near-Term Action
C.2	
Deep, rapid, and sustained mitigation and accelerated implementation of adaptation actions 
in this decade would reduce projected losses and damages for humans and ecosystems 
(very high confidence), and deliver many co-benefits, especially for air quality and health 
(high confidence). Delayed mitigation and adaptation action would lock in high-emissions 
infrastructure, raise risks of stranded assets and cost-escalation, reduce feasibility, and 
increase losses and damages (high confidence). Near-term actions involve high up-front 
investments and potentially disruptive changes that can be lessened by a range of enabling 
policies (high confidence). {2.1, 2.2, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5, 4.6, 4.7, 4.8}
C.2.1	 Deep, rapid, and sustained mitigation and accelerated implementation of adaptation actions in this decade would 
reduce future losses and damages related to climate change for humans and ecosystems (very high confidence). As 
adaptation options often have long implementation times, accelerated implementation of adaptation in this decade is 
important to close adaptation gaps (high confidence). Comprehensive, effective, and innovative responses integrating 
adaptation and mitigation can harness synergies and reduce trade-offs between adaptation and mitigation (high 
confidence). {4.1, 4.2, 4.3}
