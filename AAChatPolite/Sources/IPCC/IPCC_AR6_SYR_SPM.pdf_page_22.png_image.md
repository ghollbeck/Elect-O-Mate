The image is a complex infographic containing multiple charts, maps, and lists, providing information about how future climate change is projected to increase the severity of impacts across natural and human systems and will increase regional differences. The image is divided into several sections, each focused on a different impact of climate change. It is titled "Summary for Policymakers" and has a red banner at the top with white text. Below is a description of the content in each section of the infographic:

1. Risk of **forest fires**  
   a. This section has a line graph indicating an increase in the risk of forest fires with rising temperatures. It shows four temperature levels: 1.5°C, 2°C, 3°C, and 4°C. The graph illustrates that the risk increases significantly as the temperature rise goes from 1.5°C to 4°C.

2. **Heat-related human mortality**  
   b. There are four heat maps of the world, each corresponding to the same four temperature levels, 1.5°C, 2°C, 3°C, and 4°C, indicating the increase in heat-related human mortality. The maps use a color gradient from light orange to dark orange to signify the increasing levels of impact, with darker colors indicating a greater impact.

3. **Food production impacts**  
   c. This section contains a bullet list of two major impacts:
      - Global maize yield changes by -7% to +1% (1.5°C) and -3% to -10% (2°C)
      - Global wheat yield changes of -4% to +2% (1.5°C) and +1% to -11% (2°C)
   It also includes two world maps indicating these changes in food production, with the areas of impact highlighted using various shades of purple and green.

4. **Fisheries yield**  
   d. There is another bullet list of two impacts:
      - Global marine fisheries yield changes by +1% to -5% (1.5°C) and -3% to -8% (2°C)
      - Global inland fisheries yield changes are not quantified.
   Lastly, two world maps showcase the areas affected by changes in marine fisheries yields. The changes are visualized using various shades of blue and pink to denote increases or decreases in yield.

The section labels a), b), c), and d) are placed at the top left of each corresponding section. The temperature levels are indicated with rectangular color-coded labels (e.g., orange for 1.5°C, pink for 2°C, etc.). Each map has a legend depicting a gradient of impact severity. The maps showing heat-related mortality and fisheries use gradient symbols to indicate an increase or decrease.

The bottom right corner of the image indicates the page number as "16".

The image also includes footnotes, sources, and small text descriptions next to each map and chart that provide context, methodology, and source information. Since these are not fully legible in the image description, they cannot be transcribed accurately in detail.
