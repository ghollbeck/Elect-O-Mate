Summary for Policymakers
Summary for Policymakers
Introduction 
This Synthesis Report (SYR) of the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) summarises the state of knowledge of climate change, 
its widespread impacts and risks, and climate change mitigation and adaptation. It integrates the main findings of the Sixth 
Assessment Report (AR6) based on contributions from the three Working Groups1, and the three Special Reports2. The summary 
for Policymakers (SPM) is structured in three parts: SPM.A Current Status and Trends, SPM.B Future Climate Change, Risks, and 
Long-Term Responses, and SPM.C Responses in the Near Term3. 
This report recognizes the interdependence of climate, ecosystems and biodiversity, and human societies; the value of diverse 
forms of knowledge; and the close linkages between climate change adaptation, mitigation, ecosystem health, human well-being 
and sustainable development, and reflects the increasing diversity of actors involved in climate action. 
Based on scientific understanding, key findings can be formulated as statements of fact or associated with an assessed level of 
confidence using the IPCC calibrated language4.

The three Working Group contributions to AR6 are: AR6 Climate Change 2021: The Physical Science Basis; AR6 Climate Change 2022: Impacts, Adaptation 
and Vulnerability; and AR6 Climate Change 2022: Mitigation of Climate Change. Their assessments cover scientific literature accepted for publication 
respectively by 31 January 2021, 1 September 2021 and 11 October 2021.

The three Special Reports are: Global Warming of 1.5°C (2018): an IPCC Special Report on the impacts of global warming of 1.5°C above pre-industrial 
levels and related global greenhouse gas emission pathways, in the context of strengthening the global response to the threat of climate change, sustainable 
development, and efforts to eradicate poverty (SR1.5); Climate Change and Land (2019): an IPCC Special Report on climate change, desertification, land 
degradation, sustainable land management, food security, and greenhouse gas fluxes in terrestrial ecosystems (SRCCL); and The Ocean and Cryosphere in 
a Changing Climate (2019) (SROCC). The Special Reports cover scientific literature accepted for publication respectively by 15 May 2018, 7 April 2019 and 
15 May 2019.

In this report, the near term is defined as the period until 2040. The long term is defined as the period beyond 2040.

Each finding is grounded in an evaluation of underlying evidence and agreement. The IPCC calibrated language uses five qualifiers to express a level of 
confidence: very low, low, medium, high and very high, and typeset in italics, for example, medium confidence. The following terms are used to indicate the 
assessed likelihood of an outcome or a result: virtually certain 99–100% probability, very likely 90–100%, likely 66–100%, more likely than not >50–100%, 
about as likely as not 33–66%, unlikely 0–33%, very unlikely 0–10%, exceptionally unlikely 0–1%. Additional terms (extremely likely 95–100%; and 
extremely unlikely 0–5%) are also used when appropriate. Assessed likelihood is typeset in italics, e.g., very likely. This is consistent with AR5 and the other 
AR6 Reports.
