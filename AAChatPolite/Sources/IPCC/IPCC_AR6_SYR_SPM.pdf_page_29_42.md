Figure SPM.5: Global emissions pathways consistent with implemented policies and mitigation strategies. Panels (a), (b) and (c) show the 
development of global GHG, CO2 and methane emissions in modelled pathways, while panel (d) shows the associated timing of when GHG and CO2 emissions 
reach net zero. Coloured ranges denote the 5th to 95th percentile across the global modelled pathways falling within a given category as described in Box SPM.1. 
The red ranges depict emissions pathways assuming policies that were implemented by the end of 2020. Ranges of modelled pathways that limit warming to 
1.5°C (>50%) with no or limited overshoot are shown in light blue (category C1) and pathways that limit warming to 2°C (>67%) are shown in green (category 
C3). Global emission pathways that would limit warming to 1.5°C (>50%) with no or limited overshoot and also reach net zero GHG in the second half of the 
century do so between 2070–2075. Panel (e) shows the sectoral contributions of CO2 and non-CO2 emissions sources and sinks at the time when net zero 
CO2 emissions are reached in illustrative mitigation pathways (IMPs) consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C with a high reliance on net negative emissions 
(IMP-Neg) (“high overshoot”), high resource efficiency (IMP-LD), a focus on sustainable development (IMP-SP), renewables (IMP-Ren) and limiting warming to 
2°C with less rapid mitigation initially followed by a gradual strengthening (IMP-GS). Positive and negative emissions for different IMPs are compared to GHG 
emissions from the year 2019. Energy supply (including electricity) includes bioenergy with carbon dioxide capture and storage and direct air carbon dioxide 
capture and storage. CO2 emissions from land-use change and forestry can only be shown as a net number as many models do not report emissions and sinks 
of this category separately. {Figure 3.6, 4.1} (Box SPM.1)
Overshoot: Exceeding a Warming Level and Returning
B.7	
If warming exceeds a specified level such as 1.5°C, it could gradually be reduced again by 
achieving and sustaining net negative global CO2 emissions. This would require additional 
deployment of carbon dioxide removal, compared to pathways without overshoot, leading 
to greater feasibility and sustainability concerns. Overshoot entails adverse impacts, some 
irreversible, and additional risks for human and natural systems, all growing with the 
magnitude and duration of overshoot. (high confidence) {3.1, 3.3, 3.4, Table 3.1, Figure 3.6}
B.7.1	
Only a small number of the most ambitious global modelled pathways limit global warming to 1.5°C (>50%) by 2100 
without exceeding this level temporarily. Achieving and sustaining net negative global CO2 emissions, with annual rates 
of CDR greater than residual CO2 emissions, would gradually reduce the warming level again (high confidence). Adverse 
impacts that occur during this period of overshoot and cause additional warming via feedback mechanisms, such as 
increased wildfires, mass mortality of trees, drying of peatlands, and permafrost thawing, weakening natural land 
carbon sinks and increasing releases of GHGs would make the return more challenging (medium confidence). {3.3.2, 
3.3.4, Table 3.1, Figure 3.6} (Box SPM.1)
B.7.2	
The higher the magnitude and the longer the duration of overshoot, the more ecosystems and societies are exposed 
to greater and more widespread changes in climatic impact-drivers, increasing risks for many natural and human 
systems. Compared to pathways without overshoot, societies would face higher risks to infrastructure, low-lying 
coastal settlements, and associated livelihoods. Overshooting 1.5°C will result in irreversible adverse impacts on certain 
ecosystems with low resilience, such as polar, mountain, and coastal ecosystems, impacted by ice-sheet melt, glacier 
melt, or by accelerating and higher committed sea level rise. (high confidence) {3.1.2, 3.3.4}
B.7.3	
The larger the overshoot, the more net negative CO2 emissions would be needed to return to 1.5°C by 2100. Transitioning 
towards net zero CO2 emissions faster and reducing non-CO2 emissions such as methane more rapidly would limit 
peak warming levels and reduce the requirement for net negative CO2 emissions, thereby reducing feasibility and 
sustainability concerns, and social and environmental risks associated with CDR deployment at large scales. (high 
confidence) {3.3.3, 3.3.4, 3.4.1, Table 3.1}
