Summary for Policymakers
B.5.3	
If the annual CO2 emissions between 2020–2030 stayed, on average, at the same level as 2019, the resulting cumulative 
emissions would almost exhaust the remaining carbon budget for 1.5°C (50%), and deplete more than a third of the 
remaining carbon budget for 2°C (67%). Estimates of future CO2 emissions from existing fossil fuel infrastructures 
without additional abatement42 already exceed the remaining carbon budget for limiting warming to 1.5°C (50%) 
(high confidence). Projected cumulative future CO2 emissions over the lifetime of existing and planned fossil fuel 
infrastructure, if historical operating patterns are maintained and without additional abatement43, are approximately 
equal to the remaining carbon budget for limiting warming to 2°C with a likelihood of 83%44 (high confidence). {2.3.1, 
3.3.1, Figure 3.5}
B.5.4	
Based on central estimates only, historical cumulative net CO2 emissions between 1850 and 2019 amount to about 
four fifths45 of the total carbon budget for a 50% probability of limiting global warming to 1.5°C (central estimate about 
2900 GtCO2), and to about two thirds46 of the total carbon budget for a 67% probability to limit global warming to 2°C 
(central estimate about 3550 GtCO2). {3.3.1, Figure 3.5}
Mitigation Pathways
B.6 	
All global modelled pathways that limit warming to 1.5°C (>50%) with no or limited overshoot, 
and those that limit warming to 2°C (>67%), involve rapid and deep and, in most cases, 
immediate greenhouse gas emissions reductions in all sectors this decade. Global net zero CO2 
emissions are reached for these pathway categories, in the early 2050s and around the early 
2070s, respectively. (high confidence) {3.3, 3.4, 4.1, 4.5, Table 3.1} (Figure SPM.5, Box SPM.1)
B.6.1	
Global modelled pathways provide information on limiting warming to different levels; these pathways, particularly 
their sectoral and regional aspects, depend on the assumptions described in Box SPM.1. Global modelled pathways that 
limit warming to 1.5°C (>50%) with no or limited overshoot or limit warming to 2°C (>67%) are characterized by deep, 
rapid, and, in most cases, immediate GHG emissions reductions. Pathways that limit warming to 1.5 °C (>50%) with no 
or limited overshoot reach net zero CO2 in the early 2050s, followed by net negative CO2 emissions. Those pathways that 
reach net zero GHG emissions do so around the 2070s. Pathways that limit warming to 2 °C (>67%) reach net zero CO2 
emissions in the early 2070s. Global GHG emissions are projected to peak between 2020 and at the latest before 2025 
in global modelled pathways that limit warming to 1.5°C (>50%) with no or limited overshoot and in those that limit 
warming to 2°C (>67%) and assume immediate action. (high confidence) {3.3.2, 3.3.4, 4.1, Table 3.1, Figure 3.6} (Table

Abatement here refers to human interventions that reduce the amount of greenhouse gases that are released from fossil fuel infrastructure to the 
atmosphere.

WGI provides carbon budgets that are in line with limiting global warming to temperature limits with different likelihoods, such as 50%, 67% or 83%.

Uncertainties for total carbon budgets have not been assessed and could affect the specific calculated fractions.
