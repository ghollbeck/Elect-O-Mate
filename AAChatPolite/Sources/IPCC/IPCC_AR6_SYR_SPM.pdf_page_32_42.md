Summary for Policymakers
C.2.2	 Delayed mitigation action will further increase global warming and losses and damages will rise and additional human 
and natural systems will reach adaptation limits. Challenges from delayed adaptation and mitigation actions include the 
risk of cost escalation, lock-in of infrastructure, stranded assets, and reduced feasibility and effectiveness of adaptation 
and mitigation options. Without rapid, deep and sustained mitigation and accelerated adaptation actions, losses 
and damages will continue to increase,  including projected adverse impacts in Africa, LDCs, SIDS, Central and South 
America49, Asia and the Arctic, and will disproportionately affect the most vulnerable populations. (high confidence) 
{2.1.2, 3.1.2, 3.2, 3.3.1, 3.3.3, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3} (Figure SPM.3, Figure SPM.4)
C.2.3	 Accelerated climate action can also provide co-benefits (see also C.4) (high confidence). Many mitigation actions would 
have benefits for health through lower air pollution, active mobility (e.g., walking, cycling), and shifts to sustainable 
healthy diets (high confidence). Strong, rapid and sustained reductions in methane emissions can limit near-term 
warming and improve air quality by reducing global surface ozone (high confidence). Adaptation can generate multiple 
additional benefits such as improving agricultural productivity, innovation, health and well-being, food security, 
livelihood, and biodiversity conservation (very high confidence). {4.2, 4.5.4, 4.5.5, 4.6}
C.2.4	 Cost-benefit analysis remains limited in its ability to represent all avoided damages from climate change (high 
confidence). The economic benefits for human health from air quality improvement arising from mitigation action can 
be of the same order of magnitude as mitigation costs, and potentially even larger (medium confidence). Even without 
accounting for all the benefits of avoiding potential damages, the global economic and social benefit of limiting global 
warming to 2째C exceeds the cost of mitigation in most of the assessed literature (medium confidence)50. More rapid 
climate change mitigation, with emissions peaking earlier, increases co-benefits and reduces feasibility risks and costs 
in the long-term, but requires higher up-front investments (high confidence). {3.4.1, 4.2}
C.2.5	 Ambitious mitigation pathways imply large and sometimes disruptive changes in existing economic structures, with 
significant distributional consequences within and between countries. To accelerate climate action, the adverse 
consequences of these changes can be moderated by fiscal, financial, institutional and regulatory reforms and by 
integrating climate actions with macroeconomic policies through (i) economy-wide packages, consistent with national 
circumstances, supporting sustainable low-emission growth paths; (ii) climate resilient safety nets and social protection; 
and (iii) improved access to finance for low-emissions infrastructure and technologies, especially in developing countries. 
(high confidence) {4.2, 4.4, 4.7, 4.8.1}

The southern part of Mexico is included in the climatic subregion South Central America (SCA) for WGI. Mexico is assessed as part of North America for 
WGII. The climate change literature for the SCA region occasionally includes Mexico, and in those cases WGII assessment makes reference to Latin America. 
Mexico is considered part of Latin America and the Caribbean for WGIII.

The evidence is too limited to make a similar robust conclusion for limiting warming to 1.5째C. Limiting global warming to 1.5째C instead of 2째C would 
increase the costs of mitigation, but also increase the benefits in terms of reduced impacts and related risks, and reduced adaptation needs (high 
confidence).
