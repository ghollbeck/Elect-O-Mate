This is an image of a two-page document spread titled "Summary for Policymakers." The left page features a table and the right page contains a text section with the heading "Current Mitigation Progress, Gaps and Challenges."

The table on the left page is titled "Box SPM.1 Table 1: Description and relationship of scenarios and modelled pathways considered across AR6 Working Group reports." It has five columns and six rows, including the header row.

The first column is titled "Scenario Category (Figure SPM.1)." Each cell under this column lists a category ranging from C1 to C5.

The second column is titled "Category Description." It contains the descriptions for each scenario category, indicating the level of societal development or strategy employed in each.

The third column is "Low energy demand?" with answers "Very low (S1.1) - S1.5" going downward, except for "N/A" in the last cell corresponding to C5.

The fourth column is titled "RCMs^2 to WGII to WGIII." It contains various combinations of numbers indicating the considered pathways.

The fifth column is labeled "*Feasible to reach 1.5°C?" and it contains different comments on the feasibility of reaching the 1.5°C warming limit under each scenario.

Some footnotes are present below the table explaining the abbreviations and symbols used in the table.

The right page has two main paragraphs labeled with the letter "A" followed by a number. The first paragraph is titled "A.4" and discusses the actions and challenges associated with global greenhouse gas emissions and improvements since the preceding assessment report.

The second paragraph on the right page is titled "A.5" and continues discussing mitigation strategies, challenges, and the impacts of policies.

Both pages contain additional textual notes in smaller font sizes scattered throughout, including references at the bottom, and both are page numbered at the bottom, with "10" visible on the right page.

A graphic footer at the very bottom of the pages indicates the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) along with various other logos or marks.
