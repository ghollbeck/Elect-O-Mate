Finance, Technology and International Cooperation
C.7	
Finance, technology and international cooperation are critical enablers for accelerated climate 
action. If climate goals are to be achieved, both adaptation and mitigation financing would 
need to increase many-fold. There is sufficient global capital to close the global investment 
gaps but there are barriers to redirect capital to climate action. Enhancing technology 
innovation systems is key to accelerate the widespread adoption of technologies and 
practices. Enhancing international cooperation is possible through multiple channels. (high 
confidence) {2.3, 4.8}
C.7.1	 Improved availability of and access to finance55 would enable accelerated climate action (very high confidence). 
Addressing needs and gaps and broadening equitable access to domestic and international finance, when combined 
with other supportive actions, can act as a catalyst for accelerating adaptation and mitigation, and enabling climate 
resilient development (high confidence). If climate goals are to be achieved, and to address rising risks and accelerate 
investments in emissions reductions, both adaptation and mitigation finance would need to increase many-fold (high 
confidence). {4.8.1}
C.7.2	 Increased access to finance can build capacity and address soft limits to adaptation and avert rising risks, especially for 
developing countries, vulnerable groups, regions and sectors (high confidence). Public finance is an important enabler 
of adaptation and mitigation, and can also leverage private finance (high confidence). Average annual modelled 
mitigation investment requirements for 2020 to 2030 in scenarios that limit warming to 2°C or 1.5°C are a factor of 
three to six greater than current levels56, and total mitigation investments (public, private, domestic and international) 
would need to increase across all sectors and regions (medium confidence). Even if extensive global mitigation efforts 
are implemented, there will be a need for financial, technical, and human resources for adaptation (high confidence). 
{4.3, 4.8.1}
C.7.3	 There is sufficient global capital and liquidity to close global investment gaps, given the size of the global financial 
system, but there are barriers to redirect capital to climate action both within and outside the global financial sector and 
in the context of economic vulnerabilities and indebtedness facing developing countries. Reducing financing barriers for 
scaling up financial flows would require clear signalling and support by governments, including a stronger alignment 
of public finances in order to lower real and perceived regulatory, cost and market barriers and risks and improving 
the risk-return profile of investments. At the same time, depending on national contexts, financial actors, including 
investors, financial intermediaries, central banks and financial regulators can shift the systemic underpricing of climate-
related risks, and reduce sectoral and regional mismatches between available capital and investment needs. (high 
confidence) {4.8.1}
C.7.4	 Tracked financial flows fall short of the levels needed for adaptation and to achieve mitigation goals across all sectors 
and regions. These gaps create many opportunities and the challenge of closing gaps is largest in developing countries. 
 
Accelerated financial support for developing countries from developed countries and other sources is a critical enabler 
to enhance adaptation and mitigation actions and address inequities in access to finance, including its costs, terms 
and conditions, and economic vulnerability to climate change for developing countries. Scaled-up public grants for 
mitigation and adaptation funding for vulnerable regions, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa, would be cost-effective and 
have high social returns in terms of access to basic energy. Options for scaling up mitigation in developing countries 
include: increased levels of public finance and publicly mobilised private finance flows from developed to developing 
countries in the context of the USD 100 billion-a-year goal; increased use of public guarantees to reduce risks and 
leverage private flows at lower cost; local capital markets development; and building greater trust in international 
cooperation processes. A coordinated effort to make the post-pandemic recovery sustainable over the longer-term 
can accelerate climate action, including in developing regions and countries facing high debt costs, debt distress and 
macroeconomic uncertainty. (high confidence) {4.8.1}
C.7.5	 Enhancing technology innovation systems can provide opportunities to lower emissions growth, create social and 
environmental co-benefits, and achieve other SDGs. Policy packages tailored to national contexts and technological 
characteristics have been effective in supporting low-emission innovation and technology diffusion. Public policies can

Finance originates from diverse sources: public or private, local, national or international, bilateral or multilateral, and alternative sources. It can take the 
form of grants, technical assistance, loans (concessional and non-concessional), bonds, equity, risk insurance and financial guarantees (of different types).
