Summary for Policymakers
B.2.1	
In the near term, every region in the world is projected to face further increases in climate hazards (medium to 
high confidence, depending on region and hazard), increasing multiple risks to ecosystems and humans (very high 
confidence). Hazards and associated risks expected in the near term include an increase in heat-related human mortality 
and morbidity (high confidence), food-borne, water-borne, and vector-borne diseases (high confidence), and mental 
health challenges36 (very high confidence), flooding in coastal and other low-lying cities and regions (high confidence), 
biodiversity loss in land, freshwater and ocean ecosystems (medium to very high confidence, depending on ecosystem), 
and a decrease in food production in some regions (high confidence). Cryosphere-related changes in floods, landslides, 
and water availability have the potential to lead to severe consequences for people, infrastructure and the economy in 
most mountain regions (high confidence). The projected increase in frequency and intensity of heavy precipitation (high 
confidence) will increase rain-generated local flooding (medium confidence). {Figure 3.2, Figure 3.3, 4.3, Figure 4.3} 
(Figure SPM.3, Figure SPM.4)
B.2.2	
Risks and projected adverse impacts and related losses and damages from climate change will escalate with every 
increment of global warming (very high confidence). They are higher for global warming of 1.5°C than at present, and 
even higher at 2°C (high confidence). Compared to the AR5, global aggregated risk levels37 (Reasons for Concern38) are 
assessed to become high to very high at lower levels of global warming due to recent evidence of observed impacts, 
improved process understanding, and new knowledge on exposure and vulnerability of human and natural systems, 
including limits to adaptation (high confidence). Due to unavoidable sea level rise (see also B.3), risks for coastal 
ecosystems, people and infrastructure will continue to increase beyond 2100 (high confidence). {3.1.2, 3.1.3, Figure 3.4, 
Figure 4.3} (Figure SPM.3, Figure SPM.4)
B.2.3	
With further warming, climate change risks will become increasingly complex and more difficult to manage. Multiple 
climatic and non-climatic risk drivers will interact, resulting in compounding overall risk and risks cascading across 
sectors and regions. Climate-driven food insecurity and supply instability, for example, are projected to increase with 
increasing global warming, interacting with non-climatic risk drivers such as competition for land between urban 
expansion and food production, pandemics and conflict. (high confidence) {3.1.2, 4.3, Figure 4.3}
B.2.4	
For any given warming level, the level of risk will also depend on trends in vulnerability and exposure of humans and 
ecosystems. Future exposure to climatic hazards is increasing globally due to socio-economic development trends 
including migration, growing inequality and urbanisation. Human vulnerability will concentrate in informal settlements 
and rapidly growing smaller settlements. In rural areas vulnerability will be heightened by high reliance on climate-
sensitive livelihoods. Vulnerability of ecosystems will be strongly influenced by past, present, and future patterns of 
unsustainable consumption and production, increasing demographic pressures, and persistent unsustainable use and 
management of land, ocean, and water. Loss of ecosystems and their services has cascading and long-term impacts on 
people globally, especially for Indigenous Peoples and local communities who are directly dependent on ecosystems to 
meet basic needs. (high confidence) {Cross-Section Box.2 Figure 1c, 3.1.2, 4.3}

In all assessed regions.

Undetectable risk level indicates no associated impacts are detectable and attributable to climate change; moderate risk indicates associated impacts are 
both detectable and attributable to climate change with at least medium confidence, also accounting for the other specific criteria for key risks; high risk 
indicates severe and widespread impacts that are judged to be high on one or more criteria for assessing key risks; and very high risk level indicates very 
high risk of severe impacts and the presence of significant irreversibility or the persistence of climate-related hazards, combined with limited ability to adapt 
due to the nature of the hazard or impacts/risks. {3.1.2}

The Reasons for Concern (RFC) framework communicates scientific understanding about accrual of risk for five broad categories. RFC1: Unique and 
threatened systems: ecological and human systems that have restricted geographic ranges constrained by climate-related conditions and have high 
endemism or other distinctive properties. RFC2: Extreme weather events: risks/impacts to human health, livelihoods, assets and ecosystems from extreme 
weather events. RFC3: Distribution of impacts: risks/impacts that disproportionately affect particular groups due to uneven distribution of physical climate 
change hazards, exposure or vulnerability. RFC4: Global aggregate impacts: impacts to socio-ecological systems that can be aggregated globally into a 
single metric. RFC5: Large-scale singular events: relatively large, abrupt and sometimes irreversible changes in systems caused by global warming. See also
