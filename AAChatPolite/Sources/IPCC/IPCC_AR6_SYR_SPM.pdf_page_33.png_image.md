The image is a multi-part diagram with graphical representations and text, illustrating the opportunities for scaling up climate action in response to climate change. The visual components can be divided into two main sections: A) Feasibility of climate responses and adaptation, and B) Potential of demand-side mitigation options.

Section A) Feasibility of climate responses and adaptation is divided into several subsections and is represented by a matrix of colored dots arranged in rows and columns, each column representing a different criterion for assessing feasibility, such as 'Economic', 'Technological', 'Social', 'Institutional', 'Geophysical', 'Environmental', and 'Development'. Rows represent different climate responses and are grouped into categories like 'Energy Systems', 'Urban and infrastructure', 'Ecosystems', 'Agriculture and Forestry', and 'Cross-sectoral'. The colors of the dots indicate feasibility (from dark blue for 'high' to light blue, yellow, orange, to red for 'low').

Section B) Potential of demand-side mitigation options features two charts: B1) Global mitigation potential and B2) Techno-economic potential among regions.

B1) Global mitigation potential is a bar chart with vertical bars representing different sectors like 'Transport', 'Buildings', 'Agriculture', 'Industry', and 'Energy Supply'. Each sector bar is subdivided into colored segments indicating different levels of CO2 equivalent reduction potential in gigatons per year by 2030, with a range from less than 0.5 GtCO2eq/yr to more than 3 GtCO2eq/yr.

B2) Techno-economic potential among regions is a set of horizontal stacked bar charts shown for various world regions like 'OECD90', 'REF', 'ASIA', and 'MAF'. The bars are broken into colored segments representing different economic potential levels from less than $20/tCO2eq to greater than $100/tCO2eq, with each color indicating a specific range.

Below the figures, a set of symbols is provided to help interpret the diagrams:

- A circle with varying shades from dark blue to red indicates differing levels of feasibility.
- A black up-pointing triangle indicates transformational potential.
- A white star on a black circle indicates the need for enabling conditions for full feasibility; this is applied to climate responses.

The textual information surrounding the diagrams includes titles, descriptions, and footnotes to aid in interpreting the graphic data. For example, there's a note under the feasibility matrix stating that feasibility dimensions for some responses have overlapping meanings and diverse strategies.
