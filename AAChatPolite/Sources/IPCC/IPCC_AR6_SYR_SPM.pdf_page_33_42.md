Figure SPM.7: Multiple Opportunities for scaling up climate action. Panel (a) presents selected mitigation and adaptation options across different 
systems. The left-hand side of panel a shows climate responses and adaptation options assessed for their multidimensional feasibility at global scale, in the near 
term and up to 1.5°C global warming. As literature above 1.5°C is limited, feasibility at higher levels of warming may change, which is currently not possible 
to assess robustly. The term response is used here in addition to adaptation because some responses, such as migration, relocation and resettlement may or 
may not be considered to be adaptation. Forest based adaptation includes sustainable forest management, forest conservation and restoration, reforestation
