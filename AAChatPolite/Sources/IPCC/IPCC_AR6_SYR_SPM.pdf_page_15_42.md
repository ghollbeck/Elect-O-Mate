A.3.6	 Key barriers to adaptation are limited resources, lack of private sector and citizen engagement, insufficient mobilization 
of finance (including for research), low climate literacy, lack of political commitment, limited research and/or slow and 
low uptake of adaptation science, and low sense of urgency. There are widening disparities between the estimated costs 
of adaptation and the finance allocated to adaptation (high confidence). Adaptation finance has come predominantly 
from public sources, and a small proportion of global tracked climate finance was targeted to adaptation and an 
overwhelming majority to mitigation (very high confidence). Although global tracked climate finance has shown 
an upward trend since AR5, current global financial flows for adaptation, including from public and private finance 
sources, are insufficient and constrain implementation of adaptation options, especially in developing countries (high 
confidence).  Adverse climate impacts can reduce the availability of financial resources by incurring losses and damages 
and through impeding national economic growth, thereby further increasing financial constraints for adaptation, 
particularly for developing and least developed countries (medium confidence). {2.3.2, 2.3.3}
Box SPM.1 The use of scenarios and modelled pathways in the AR6 Synthesis Report
Modelled scenarios and pathways19 are used to explore future emissions, climate change, related impacts and risks, and 
possible mitigation and adaptation strategies and are based on a range of assumptions, including socio-economic variables 
and mitigation options. These are quantitative projections and are neither predictions nor forecasts. Global modelled emission 
pathways, including those based on cost effective approaches contain regionally differentiated assumptions and outcomes, 
and have to be assessed with the careful recognition of these assumptions. Most do not make explicit assumptions about 
global equity, environmental justice or intra-regional income distribution. IPCC is neutral with regard to the assumptions 
underlying the scenarios in the literature assessed in this report, which do not cover all possible futures.20 {Cross-Section Box.2}
WGI assessed the climate response to five illustrative scenarios based on Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs)21 that 
cover the range of possible future development of anthropogenic drivers of climate change found in the literature. High and 
very high GHG emissions scenarios (SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.522) have CO2 emissions that roughly double from current levels 
by 2100 and 2050, respectively. The intermediate GHG emissions scenario (SSP2-4.5) has CO2 emissions remaining around 
current levels until the middle of the century. The very low and low GHG emissions scenarios (SSP1-1.9 and SSP1-2.6) have 
CO2 emissions declining to net zero around 2050 and 2070, respectively, followed by varying levels of net negative CO2 
emissions. In addition, Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs)23 were used by WGI and WGII to assess regional climate 
changes, impacts and risks. In WGIII, a large number of global modelled emissions pathways were assessed, of which 1202 
pathways were categorised based on their assessed global warming over the 21st century; categories range from pathways 
that limit warming to 1.5°C with more than 50% likelihood (noted >50% in this report) with no or limited overshoot (C1) to 
pathways that exceed 4°C (C8). {Cross-Section Box.2} (Box SPM.1, Table 1)
Global warming levels (GWLs) relative to 1850–1900 are used to integrate the assessment of climate change and related 
impacts and risks since patterns of changes for many variables at a given GWL are common to all scenarios considered and 
independent of timing when that level is reached. {Cross-Section Box.2}

In the literature, the terms pathways and scenarios are used interchangeably, with the former more frequently used in relation to climate goals. WGI 
primarily used the term scenarios and WGIII mostly used the term modelled emission and mitigation pathways. The SYR primarily uses scenarios when 
referring to WGI and modelled emission and mitigation pathways when referring to WGIII.
20	
Around half of all modelled global emission pathways assume cost-effective approaches that rely on least-cost mitigation/abatement options globally. The 
other half looks at existing policies and regionally and sectorally differentiated actions.

SSP-based scenarios are referred to as SSPx-y, where ‘SSPx’ refers to the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway describing the socioeconomic trends underlying the 
scenarios, and ‘y’ refers to the level of radiative forcing (in watts per square metre, or W m-2) resulting from the scenario in the year 2100. {Cross-Section Box.2}
22	
Very high emissions scenarios have become less likely but cannot be ruled out. Warming levels >4°C may result from very high emissions scenarios, but can 
also occur from lower emission scenarios if climate sensitivity or carbon cycle feedbacks are higher than the best estimate. {3.1.1}
23	
RCP-based scenarios are referred to as RCPy, where ‘y’ refers to the level of radiative forcing (in watts per square metre, or W m-2) resulting from the 
scenario in the year 2100. The SSP scenarios cover a broader range of greenhouse gas and air pollutant futures than the RCPs. They are similar but not 
identical, with differences in concentration trajectories. The overall effective radiative forcing tends to be higher for the SSPs compared to the RCPs with the 
same label (medium confidence). {Cross-Section Box.2}
