Industry and Transport
C.3.3	 Reducing industry GHG emissions entails coordinated action throughout value chains to promote all mitigation 
options, including demand management, energy and materials efficiency, circular material flows, as well as abatement 
technologies and transformational changes in production processes (high confidence). In transport, sustainable 
biofuels, low-emissions hydrogen, and derivatives (including ammonia and synthetic fuels) can support mitigation of 
CO2 emissions from shipping, aviation, and heavy-duty land transport but require production process improvements 
and cost reductions (medium confidence). Sustainable biofuels can offer additional mitigation benefits in land-based 
transport in the short and medium term (medium confidence). Electric vehicles powered by low-GHG emissions 
electricity have large potential to reduce land-based transport GHG emissions, on a life cycle basis (high confidence). 
Advances in battery technologies could facilitate the electrification of heavy-duty trucks and compliment conventional 
electric rail systems (medium confidence). The environmental footprint of battery production and growing concerns 
about critical minerals can be addressed by material and supply diversification strategies, energy and material efficiency 
improvements, and circular material flows (medium confidence). {4.5.2, 4.5.3} (Figure SPM.7)
Cities, Settlements and Infrastructure 
C.3.4	 Urban systems are critical for achieving deep emissions reductions and advancing climate resilient development (high 
confidence). Key adaptation and mitigation elements in cities include considering climate change impacts and risks 
(e.g., through climate services) in the design and planning of settlements and infrastructure; land use planning to 
achieve compact urban form, co-location of jobs and housing; supporting public transport and active mobility (e.g., 
walking and cycling); the efficient design, construction, retrofit, and use of buildings; reducing and changing energy 
and material consumption; sufficiency52; material substitution; and electrification in combination with low emissions 
sources (high confidence). Urban transitions that offer benefits for mitigation, adaptation, human health and well-
being, ecosystem services, and vulnerability reduction for low-income communities are fostered by inclusive long-term 
planning that takes an integrated approach to physical, natural and social infrastructure (high confidence). Green/
natural and blue infrastructure supports carbon uptake and storage and either singly or when combined with grey 
infrastructure can reduce energy use and risk from extreme events such as heatwaves, flooding, heavy precipitation and 
droughts, while generating co-benefits for health, well-being and livelihoods (medium confidence). {4.5.3}
Land, Ocean, Food, and Water
C.3.5	 Many agriculture, forestry, and other land use (AFOLU) options provide adaptation and mitigation benefits that could 
be upscaled in the near term across most regions. Conservation, improved management, and restoration of forests 
and other ecosystems offer the largest share of economic mitigation potential, with reduced deforestation in tropical 
regions having the highest total mitigation potential. Ecosystem restoration, reforestation, and afforestation can lead to 
trade-offs due to competing demands on land. Minimizing trade-offs requires integrated approaches to meet multiple 
objectives including food security. Demand-side measures (shifting to sustainable healthy diets53 and reducing food loss/
waste) and sustainable agricultural intensification can reduce ecosystem conversion, and methane and nitrous oxide 
emissions, and free up land for reforestation and ecosystem restoration. Sustainably sourced agricultural and forest 
products, including long-lived wood products, can be used instead of more GHG-intensive products in other sectors. 
Effective adaptation options include cultivar improvements, agroforestry, community-based adaptation, farm and 
landscape diversification, and urban agriculture. These AFOLU response options require integration of biophysical, 
socioeconomic and other enabling factors. Some options, such as conservation of high-carbon ecosystems (e.g., peatlands, 
wetlands, rangelands, mangroves and forests), deliver immediate benefits, while others, such as restoration of high-carbon 
ecosystems, take decades to deliver measurable results. (high confidence) {4.5.4} (Figure SPM.7)
C.3.6	 Maintaining the resilience of biodiversity and ecosystem services at a global scale depends on effective and equitable 
conservation of approximately 30% to 50% of Earth’s land, freshwater and ocean areas, including currently near-
natural ecosystems (high confidence). Conservation, protection and restoration of terrestrial, freshwater, coastal and

‘Sustainable healthy diets’ promote all dimensions of individuals’ health and well-being; have low environmental pressure and impact; are accessible, 
affordable, safe and equitable; and are culturally acceptable, as described in FAO and WHO. The related concept of ‘balanced diets’ refers to diets that 
feature plant-based foods, such as those based on coarse grains, legumes, fruits and vegetables, nuts and seeds, and animal-sourced food produced in 
resilient, sustainable and low-GHG emission systems, as described in SRCCL.
