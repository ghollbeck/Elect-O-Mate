public. From 2010 to 2019 there have been sustained decreases in the unit costs of solar energy (85%), wind energy 
(55%), and lithium-ion batteries (85%), and large increases in their deployment, e.g., >10× for solar and >100× for 
electric vehicles (EVs), varying widely across regions. The mix of policy instruments that reduced costs and stimulated 
adoption includes public R&D, funding for demonstration and pilot projects, and demand-pull instruments such as 
deployment subsidies to attain scale. Maintaining emission-intensive systems may, in some regions and sectors, be 
more expensive than transitioning to low emission systems. (high confidence) {2.2.2, Figure 2.4}
A.4.3	 A substantial ‘emissions gap’ exists between global GHG emissions in 2030 associated with the implementation of 
NDCs announced prior to COP2626 and those associated with modelled mitigation pathways that limit warming to 1.5°C 
(>50%) with no or limited overshoot or limit warming to 2°C (>67%) assuming immediate action (high confidence). This 
would make it likely that warming will exceed 1.5°C during the 21st century (high confidence). Global modelled mitigation 
pathways that limit warming to 1.5°C (>50%) with no or limited overshoot or limit warming to 2°C (>67%) assuming 
immediate action imply deep global GHG emissions reductions this decade (high confidence) (see SPM Box 1, Table 1, B.6)27. 
Modelled pathways that are consistent with NDCs announced prior to COP26 until 2030 and assume no increase in 
ambition thereafter have higher emissions, leading to a median global warming of 2.8 [2.1 to 3.4] °C by 2100 (medium 
confidence). Many countries have signalled an intention to achieve net zero GHG or net zero CO2 by around mid-century 
but pledges differ across countries in terms of scope and specificity, and limited policies are to date in place to deliver 
on them. {2.3.1, Table 2.2, Figure 2.5, Table 3.1, 4.1}
A.4.4	 Policy coverage is uneven across sectors (high confidence). Policies implemented by the end of 2020 are projected to 
result in higher global GHG emissions in 2030 than emissions implied by NDCs, indicating an ‘implementation gap’ 
(high confidence). Without a strengthening of policies, global warming of 3.2 [2.2 to 3.5] °C is projected by 2100 
(medium confidence). {2.2.2, 2.3.1, 3.1.1, Figure 2.5} (Box SPM.1, Figure SPM.5)
A.4.5 	 The adoption of low-emission technologies lags in most developing countries, particularly least developed ones, due 
in part to limited finance, technology development and transfer, and capacity (medium confidence). The magnitude 
of climate finance flows has increased over the last decade and financing channels have broadened but growth has 
slowed since 2018 (high confidence). Financial flows have developed heterogeneously across regions and sectors 
(high confidence). Public and private finance flows for fossil fuels are still greater than those for climate adaptation 
and mitigation (high confidence). The overwhelming majority of tracked climate finance is directed towards mitigation, 
but nevertheless falls short of the levels needed to limit warming to below 2°C or to 1.5°C across all sectors and 
regions (see C7.2) (very high confidence). In 2018, public and publicly mobilised private climate finance flows from 
developed to developing countries were below the collective goal under the UNFCCC and Paris Agreement to mobilise 
USD 100 billion per year by 2020 in the context of meaningful mitigation action and transparency on implementation 
(medium confidence). {2.2.2, 2.3.1, 2.3.3}

Due to the literature cutoff date of WGIII, the additional NDCs submitted after 11 October 2021 are not assessed here. {Footnote 32 in the Longer Report}

Projected 2030 GHG emissions are 50 (47–55) GtCO2-eq if all conditional NDC elements are taken into account. Without conditional elements, the global 
emissions are projected to be approximately similar to modelled 2019 levels at 53 (50–57) GtCO2-eq. {2.3.1, Table 2.2}
