5Projected regional impacts reﬂect ﬁsheries and marine ecosystem responses to ocean physical and biogeochemical conditions such as 
temperature, oxygen level and net primary production. Models do not represent changes in ﬁshing activities and some extreme climatic 
conditions. Projected changes in the Arctic regions have low conﬁdence due to uncertainties associated with modelling multiple interacting 
drivers and ecosystem responses.
4Projected regional impacts reﬂect biophysical responses to changing temperature, precipitation, solar radiation, humidity, wind, and CO2 
enhancement of growth and water retention in currently cultivated areas. Models assume that irrigated areas are not water-limited. 
Models do not represent pests, diseases, future agro-technological changes and some extreme climate responses.
Future climate change is projected to increase the severity of impacts 
across natural and human systems and will increase regional differences

no species relocation.

cephalopods, corals, and seagrasses.

3Projected regional impacts utilize a global threshold beyond which daily mean surface air temperature and relative humidity may induce 
hyperthermia that poses a risk of mortality. The duration and intensity of heatwaves are not presented here. Heat-related health outcomes 
vary by location and are highly moderated by socio-economic, occupational and other non-climatic determinants of individual health and 
socio-economic vulnerability. The threshold used in these maps is based on a single study that synthesized data from 783 cases to 
determine the relationship between heat-humidity conditions and mortality drawn largely from observations in temperate climates.

Figure SPM.3: Projected risks and impacts of climate change on natural and human systems at different global warming levels (GWLs) relative to 1850-1900 
levels. Projected risks and impacts shown on the maps are based on outputs from different subsets of Earth system and impact models that were used to project 
each impact indicator without additional adaptation. WGII provides further assessment of the impacts on human and natural systems using these projections 
and additional lines of evidence. (a) Risks of species losses as indicated by the percentage of assessed species exposed to potentially dangerous temperature 
conditions, as defined by conditions beyond the estimated historical (1850–2005) maximum mean annual temperature experienced by each species, at GWLs 
of 1.5°C, 2°C, 3°C and 4°C. Underpinning projections of temperature are from 21 Earth system models and do not consider extreme events impacting 
ecosystems such as the Arctic. (b) Risks to human health as indicated by the days per year of population exposure to hyperthermic conditions that pose a risk 
of mortality from surface air temperature and humidity conditions for historical period (1991–2005) and at GWLs of 1.7°C–2.3°C (mean = 1.9°C; 13 climate 
models), 2.4°C–3.1°C (2.7°C; 16 climate models) and 4.2°C–5.4°C (4.7°C; 15 climate models). Interquartile ranges of GWLs by 2081–2100 under RCP2.6, 
RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. The presented index is consistent with common features found in many indices included within WGI and WGII assessments. (c) Impacts 
on food production: (c1) Changes in maize yield by 2080–2099 relative to 1986–2005 at projected GWLs of 1.6°C–2.4°C (2.0°C), 3.3°C–4.8°C (4.1°C) and 
3.9°C–6.0°C (4.9°C). Median yield changes from an ensemble of 12 crop models, each driven by bias-adjusted outputs from 5 Earth system models, from 
the Agricultural Model Intercomparison and Improvement Project (AgMIP) and the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISIMIP). Maps depict
