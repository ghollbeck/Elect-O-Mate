support training and R&D, complemented by both regulatory and market-based instruments that create incentives and 
market opportunities. Technological innovation can have trade-offs such as new and greater environmental impacts, 
social inequalities, overdependence on foreign knowledge and providers, distributional impacts and rebound effects57, 
requiring appropriate governance and policies to enhance potential and reduce trade-offs. Innovation and adoption of 
low-emission technologies lags in most developing countries, particularly least developed ones, due in part to weaker 
enabling conditions, including limited finance, technology development and transfer, and capacity building. (high 
confidence) {4.8.3}
C.7.6	 International cooperation is a critical enabler for achieving ambitious climate change mitigation, adaptation, and climate 
resilient development (high confidence). Climate resilient development is enabled by increased international cooperation 
including mobilising and enhancing access to finance, particularly for developing countries, vulnerable regions, sectors 
and groups and aligning finance flows for climate action to be consistent with ambition levels and funding needs (high 
confidence). Enhancing international cooperation on finance, technology and capacity building can enable greater 
ambition and can act as a catalyst for accelerating mitigation and adaptation, and shifting development pathways 
towards sustainability (high confidence). This includes support to NDCs and accelerating technology development and 
deployment (high confidence). Transnational partnerships can stimulate policy development, technology diffusion, 
adaptation and mitigation, though uncertainties remain over their costs, feasibility and effectiveness (medium 
confidence).  International environmental and sectoral agreements, institutions and initiatives are helping, and in some 
cases may help, to stimulate low GHG emissions investments and reduce emissions (medium confidence). {2.2.2, 4.8.2}
