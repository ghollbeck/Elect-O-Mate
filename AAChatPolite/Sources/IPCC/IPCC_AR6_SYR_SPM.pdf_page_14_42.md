Summary for Policymakers
representative generations (born in 1950, 1980 and 2020). Future projections (2021–2100) of changes in global surface temperature are shown for very low 
(SSP1-1.9), low (SSP1-2.6), intermediate (SSP2-4.5), high (SSP3-7.0) and very high (SSP5-8.5) GHG emissions scenarios. Changes in annual global surface 
temperatures are presented as ‘climate stripes’, with future projections showing the human-caused long-term trends and continuing modulation by natural 
variability (represented here using observed levels of past natural variability). Colours on the generational icons correspond to the global surface temperature 
stripes for each year, with segments on future icons differentiating possible future experiences. {2.1, 2.1.2, Figure 2.1, Table 2.1, Figure 2.3, Cross-Section Box.2,

Current Progress in Adaptation and Gaps and Challenges
A.3	
Adaptation planning and implementation has progressed across all sectors and regions, 
with documented benefits and varying effectiveness. Despite progress, adaptation gaps 
exist, and will continue to grow at current rates of implementation. Hard and soft limits to 
adaptation have been reached in some ecosystems and regions. Maladaptation is happening 
in some sectors and regions. Current global financial flows for adaptation are insufficient 
for, and constrain implementation of, adaptation options, especially in developing countries 
(high confidence). {2.2, 2.3}
A.3.1	 Progress in adaptation planning and implementation has been observed across all sectors and regions, generating 
multiple benefits (very high confidence). Growing public and political awareness of climate impacts and risks has 
resulted in at least 170 countries and many cities including adaptation in their climate policies and planning processes 
(high confidence). {2.2.3}
A.3.2	 Effectiveness15 of adaptation in reducing climate risks16 is documented for specific contexts, sectors and regions (high 
confidence). Examples of effective adaptation options include: cultivar improvements, on-farm water management and 
storage, soil moisture conservation, irrigation, agroforestry, community-based adaptation, farm and landscape level 
diversification in agriculture, sustainable land management approaches, use of agroecological principles and practices 
and other approaches that work with natural processes (high confidence). Ecosystem-based adaptation17 approaches 
such as urban greening, restoration of wetlands and upstream forest ecosystems have been effective in reducing 
flood risks and urban heat (high confidence). Combinations of non-structural measures like early warning systems and 
structural measures like levees have reduced loss of lives in case of inland flooding (medium confidence). Adaptation 
options such as disaster risk management, early warning systems, climate services and social safety nets have broad 
applicability across multiple sectors (high confidence). {2.2.3}
A.3.3	 Most observed adaptation responses are fragmented, incremental18, sector-specific and unequally distributed across 
regions. Despite progress, adaptation gaps exist across sectors and regions, and will continue to grow under current 
levels of implementation, with the largest adaptation gaps among lower income groups. (high confidence) {2.3.2}
A.3.4	 There is increased evidence of maladaptation in various sectors and regions. Maladaptation especially affects 
marginalised and vulnerable groups adversely. (high confidence) {2.3.2}
A.3.5	 Soft limits to adaptation are currently being experienced by small-scale farmers and households along some low-
lying coastal areas (medium confidence) resulting from financial, governance, institutional and policy constraints 
(high confidence). Some tropical, coastal, polar and mountain ecosystems have reached hard adaptation limits (high 
confidence). Adaptation does not prevent all losses and damages, even with effective adaptation and before reaching 
soft and hard limits (high confidence). {2.3.2}

Effectiveness refers here to the extent to which an adaptation option is anticipated or observed to reduce climate-related risk. {2.2.3}

Ecosystem-based Adaptation (EbA) is recognized internationally under the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD14/5). A related concept is Nature-based 
Solutions (NbS), see Annex I: Glossary.

Incremental adaptations to change in climate are understood as extensions of actions and behaviours that already reduce the losses or enhance the 
benefits of natural variations in extreme weather/climate events. {2.3.2}
