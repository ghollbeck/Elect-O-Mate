Summary for Policymakers
C.4.3	 Implementing both mitigation and adaptation actions together and taking trade-offs into account supports co-benefits 
and synergies for human health and well-being. For example, improved access to clean energy sources and technologies 
generates health benefits especially for women and children; electrification combined with low-GHG energy, and shifts 
to active mobility and public transport can enhance air quality, health, employment, and can elicit energy security and 
deliver equity. (high confidence) {4.2, 4.5.3, 4.5.5, 4.6, 4.9}
Equity and Inclusion
C.5	
Prioritising equity, climate justice, social justice, inclusion and just transition processes can 
enable adaptation and ambitious mitigation actions and climate resilient development. 
Adaptation outcomes are enhanced by increased support to regions and people with the 
highest vulnerability to climatic hazards. Integrating climate adaptation into social protection 
programs improves resilience. Many options are available for reducing emission-intensive 
consumption, including through behavioural and lifestyle changes, with co-benefits for 
societal well-being. (high confidence) {4.4, 4.5}
C.5.1	 Equity remains a central element in the UN climate regime, notwithstanding shifts in differentiation between states 
over time and challenges in assessing fair shares. Ambitious mitigation pathways imply large and sometimes disruptive 
changes in economic structure, with significant distributional consequences, within and between countries. Distributional 
consequences within and between countries include shifting of income and employment during the transition from 
high- to low-emissions activities. (high confidence) {4.4}
C.5.2	 Adaptation and mitigation actions that prioritise equity, social justice, climate justice, rights-based approaches, and 
inclusivity, lead to more sustainable outcomes, reduce trade-offs, support transformative change and advance climate 
resilient development. Redistributive policies across sectors and regions that shield the poor and vulnerable, social 
safety nets, equity, inclusion and just transitions, at all scales can enable deeper societal ambitions and resolve trade-
offs with sustainable development goals. Attention to equity and broad and meaningful participation of all relevant 
actors in decision making at all scales can build social trust which builds on equitable sharing of benefits and burdens 
of mitigation that deepen and widen support for transformative changes. (high confidence) {4.4}
C.5.3	 Regions and people (3.3 to 3.6 billion in number) with considerable development constraints have high vulnerability to 
climatic hazards (see A.2.2). Adaptation outcomes for the most vulnerable within and across countries and regions are 
enhanced through approaches focusing on equity, inclusivity and rights-based approaches. Vulnerability is exacerbated 
by inequity and marginalisation linked to e.g., gender, ethnicity, low incomes, informal settlements, disability, age, 
and historical and ongoing patterns of inequity such as colonialism, especially for many Indigenous Peoples and local 
communities. Integrating climate adaptation into social protection programs, including cash transfers and public works 
programs, is highly feasible and increases resilience to climate change, especially when supported by basic services 
and infrastructure. The greatest gains in well-being in urban areas can be achieved by prioritising access to finance to 
reduce climate risk for low-income and marginalised communities including people living in informal settlements. (high 
confidence) {4.4, 4.5.3, 4.5.5, 4.5.6}
C.5.4 	 The design of regulatory instruments and economic instruments and consumption-based approaches, can advance equity. 
Individuals with high socio-economic status contribute disproportionately to emissions, and have the highest potential 
for emissions reductions. Many options are available for reducing emission-intensive consumption while improving 
societal well-being. Socio-cultural options, behaviour and lifestyle changes supported by policies, infrastructure, and 
technology can help end-users shift to low-emissions-intensive consumption, with multiple co-benefits.  A substantial 
share of the population in low-emitting countries lack access to modern energy services. Technology development, 
transfer, capacity building and financing can support developing countries / regions leapfrogging or transitioning to 
low-emissions transport systems thereby providing multiple co-benefits. Climate resilient development is advanced 
when actors work in equitable, just and inclusive ways to reconcile divergent interests, values and worldviews, toward 
equitable and just outcomes. (high confidence) {2.1, 4.4}
