climate events and seasons (high confidence). In scenarios with increasing CO2 emissions, natural land and ocean 
carbon sinks are projected to take up a decreasing proportion of these emissions (high confidence). Other projected 
changes include further reduced extents and/or volumes of almost all cryospheric elements34 (high confidence), further 
global mean sea level rise (virtually certain), and increased ocean acidification (virtually certain) and deoxygenation 
(high confidence). {3.1.1, 3.3.1, Figure 3.4} (Figure SPM.2)

With further warming, every region is projected to increasingly experience concurrent and multiple changes in climatic 
impact-drivers. Compound heatwaves and droughts are projected to become more frequent, including concurrent 
events across multiple locations (high confidence). Due to relative sea level rise, current 1-in-100 year extreme sea 
level events are projected to occur at least annually in more than half of all tide gauge locations by 2100 under all 
considered scenarios (high confidence). Other projected regional changes include intensification of tropical cyclones 
and/or extratropical storms (medium confidence), and increases in aridity and fire weather (medium to high confidence).

B.1.5	
Natural variability will continue to modulate human-caused climate changes, either attenuating or amplifying projected 
changes, with little effect on centennial-scale global warming (high confidence). These modulations are important to 
consider in adaptation planning, especially at the regional scale and in the near term. If a large explosive volcanic 
eruption were to occur35, it would temporarily and partially mask human-caused climate change by reducing global 
surface temperature and precipitation for one to three years (medium confidence). {4.3}

Based on 2500-year reconstructions, eruptions with a radiative forcing more negative than â€“1 W m-2, related to the radiative effect of volcanic stratospheric 
aerosols in the literature assessed in this report, occur on average twice per century. {4.3}
