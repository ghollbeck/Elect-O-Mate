A. Current Status and Trends
Observed Warming and its Causes
A.1	
Human activities, principally through emissions of greenhouse gases, have unequivocally 
caused global warming, with global surface temperature reaching 1.1°C above 1850-1900 
in 2011-2020. Global greenhouse gas emissions have continued to increase, with unequal 
historical and ongoing contributions arising from unsustainable energy use, land use and 
land-use change, lifestyles and patterns of consumption and production across regions, 
between and within countries, and among individuals (high confidence). {2.1, Figure 2.1, 
Figure 2.2}
A.1.1	 Global surface temperature was 1.09 [0.95 to 1.20]°C5 higher in 2011–2020 than 1850–19006, with larger increases 
over land (1.59 [1.34 to 1.83]°C) than over the ocean (0.88 [0.68 to 1.01]°C). Global surface temperature in the first two 
decades of the 21st century (2001–2020) was 0.99 [0.84 to 1.10]°C higher than 1850–1900. Global surface temperature 
has increased faster since 1970 than in any other 50-year period over at least the last 2000 years (high confidence). 
{2.1.1, Figure 2.1}
A.1.2 	 The likely range of total human-caused global surface temperature increase from 1850–1900 to 2010–20197 is 0.8°C to 
1.3°C, with a best estimate of 1.07°C. Over this period, it is likely that well-mixed greenhouse gases (GHGs) contributed 
a warming of 1.0°C to 2.0°C8, and other human drivers (principally aerosols) contributed a cooling of 0.0°C to 0.8°C, 
natural (solar and volcanic) drivers changed global surface temperature by –0.1°C to +0.1°C, and internal variability 
changed it by –0.2°C to +0.2°C. {2.1.1, Figure 2.1}
A.1.3	 Observed increases in well-mixed GHG concentrations since around 1750 are unequivocally caused by GHG emissions 
from human activities over this period. Historical cumulative net CO2 emissions from 1850 to 2019 were 2400 ± 240 GtCO2 
of which more than half (58%) occurred between 1850 and 1989, and about 42% occurred between 1990 and 2019 (high 
confidence). In 2019, atmospheric CO2 concentrations (410 parts per million) were higher than at any time in at least 2 
million years (high confidence), and concentrations of methane (1866 parts per billion) and nitrous oxide (332 parts per 
billion) were higher than at any time in at least 800,000 years (very high confidence). {2.1.1, Figure 2.1}
A.1.4	 Global net anthropogenic GHG emissions have been estimated to be 59 ± 6.6 GtCO2-eq9 in 2019, about 12% (6.5 GtCO2-eq) 
higher than in 2010 and 54% (21 GtCO2-eq) higher than in 1990, with the largest share and growth in gross GHG emissions 
occurring in CO2 from fossil fuels combustion and industrial processes (CO2-FFI) followed by methane, whereas the highest 
relative growth occurred in fluorinated gases (F-gases), starting from low levels in 1990. Average annual GHG emissions 
during 2010–2019 were higher than in any previous decade on record, while the rate of growth between 2010 and 
2019 (1.3% yr-1) was lower than that between 2000 and 2009 (2.1% yr-1). In 2019, approximately 79% of global GHG

The estimated increase in global surface temperature since AR5 is principally due to further warming since 2003–2012 (0.19 [0.16 to 0.22] °C). Additionally, 
methodological advances and new datasets have provided a more complete spatial representation of changes in surface temperature, including in the 
Arctic. These and other improvements have also increased the estimate of global surface temperature change by approximately 0.1°C, but this increase 
does not represent additional physical warming since AR5.

The period distinction with A.1.1 arises because the attribution studies consider this slightly earlier period. The observed warming to 2010–2019 
is 1.06 [0.88 to 1.21]°C.

Contributions from emissions to the 2010–2019 warming relative to 1850–1900 assessed from radiative forcing studies are: CO2 0.8 [0.5 to 1.2]°C; 
methane 0.5 [0.3 to 0.8]°C; nitrous oxide 0.1 [0.0 to 0.2]°C and fluorinated gases 0.1 [0.0 to 0.2]°C. {2.1.1}

GHG emission metrics are used to express emissions of different greenhouse gases in a common unit. Aggregated GHG emissions in this report are stated in CO2-
equivalents (CO2-eq) using the Global Warming Potential with a time horizon of 100 years (GWP100) with values based on the contribution of Working Group I to 
the AR6. The AR6 WGI and WGIII reports contain updated emission metric values, evaluations of different metrics with regard to mitigation objectives, and 
assess new approaches to aggregating gases. The choice of metric depends on the purpose of the analysis and all GHG emission metrics have limitations 
and uncertainties, given that they simplify the complexity of the physical climate system and its response to past and future GHG emissions. {2.1.1}
