Figure SPM.4: Subset of assessed climate outcomes and associated global and regional climate risks. The burning embers result from a literature 
based expert elicitation. Panel (a): Left – Global surface temperature changes in °C relative to 1850–1900. These changes were obtained by combining CMIP6 
model simulations with observational constraints based on past simulated warming, as well as an updated assessment of equilibrium climate sensitivity. Very 
likely ranges are shown for the low and high GHG emissions scenarios (SSP1-2.6 and SSP3-7.0) (Cross-Section Box.2). Right – Global Reasons for Concern 
(RFC), comparing AR6 (thick embers) and AR5 (thin embers) assessments. Risk transitions have generally shifted towards lower temperatures with updated 
scientific understanding. Diagrams are shown for each RFC, assuming low to no adaptation. Lines connect the midpoints of the transitions from moderate to high 
risk across AR5 and AR6. Panel (b): Selected global risks for land and ocean ecosystems, illustrating general increase of risk with global warming levels with low 
to no adaptation. Panel (c): Left - Global mean sea level change in centimetres, relative to 1900. The historical changes (black) are observed by tide gauges 
before 1992 and altimeters afterwards. The future changes to 2100 (coloured lines and shading) are assessed consistently with observational constraints based 
on emulation of CMIP, ice-sheet, and glacier models, and likely ranges are shown for SSP1-2.6 and SSP3-7.0. Right - Assessment of the combined risk of coastal 
flooding, erosion and salinization for four illustrative coastal geographies in 2100, due to changing mean and extreme sea levels, under two response scenarios, 
with respect to the SROCC baseline period (1986–2005). The assessment does not account for changes in extreme sea level beyond those directly induced by 
mean sea level rise; risk levels could increase if other changes in extreme sea levels were considered (e.g., due to changes in cyclone intensity). “No-to-moderate 
response” describes efforts as of today (i.e., no further significant action or new types of actions). “Maximum potential response” represent a combination of 
responses implemented to their full extent and thus significant additional efforts compared to today, assuming minimal financial, social and political barriers. 
(In this context, ‘today’ refers to 2019.) The assessment criteria include exposure and vulnerability, coastal hazards, in-situ responses and planned relocation. 
Planned relocation refers to managed retreat or resettlements. The term response is used here instead of adaptation because some responses, such as retreat, 
may or may not be considered to be adaptation. Panel (d): Selected risks under different socio-economic pathways, illustrating how development strategies 
and challenges to adaptation influence risk. Left - Heat-sensitive human health outcomes under three scenarios of adaptation effectiveness. The diagrams are 
truncated at the nearest whole ºC within the range of temperature change in 2100 under three SSP scenarios. Right - Risks associated with food security due to 
climate change and patterns of socio-economic development. Risks to food security include availability and access to food, including population at risk of hunger, 
food price increases and increases in disability adjusted life years attributable to childhood underweight. Risks are assessed for two contrasted socio-economic 
pathways (SSP1 and SSP3) excluding the effects of targeted mitigation and adaptation policies. {Figure 3.3} (Box SPM.1)
Likelihood and Risks of Unavoidable, Irreversible or Abrupt 
Changes
B.3	
Some future changes are unavoidable and/or irreversible but can be limited by deep, rapid, 
and sustained global greenhouse gas emissions reduction. The likelihood of abrupt and/or 
irreversible changes increases with higher global warming levels. Similarly, the probability 
of low-likelihood outcomes associated with potentially very large adverse impacts increases 
with higher global warming levels. (high confidence) {3.1}
B.3.1	
Limiting global surface temperature does not prevent continued changes in climate system components that have 
multi-decadal or longer timescales of response (high confidence). Sea level rise is unavoidable for centuries to millennia 
due to continuing deep ocean warming and ice sheet melt, and sea levels will remain elevated for thousands of years 
(high confidence). However, deep, rapid, and sustained GHG emissions reductions would limit further sea level rise 
acceleration and projected long-term sea level rise commitment. Relative to 1995–2014, the likely global mean sea 
level rise under the SSP1-1.9 GHG emissions scenario is 0.15–0.23 m by 2050 and 0.28–0.55 m by 2100; while for the 
SSP5-8.5 GHG emissions scenario it is 0.20–0.29 m by 2050 and 0.63–1.01 m by 2100 (medium confidence). Over the 
next 2000 years, global mean sea level will rise by about 2–3 m if warming is limited to 1.5°C and 2–6 m if limited to 
2°C (low confidence). {3.1.3, Figure 3.4} (Box SPM.1)
B.3.2	
The likelihood and impacts of abrupt and/or irreversible changes in the climate system, including changes triggered 
when tipping points are reached, increase with further global warming (high confidence). As warming levels increase, so 
do the risks of species extinction or irreversible loss of biodiversity in ecosystems including forests (medium confidence), 
coral reefs (very high confidence) and in Arctic regions (high confidence). At sustained warming levels between 2°C and 
3°C, the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets will be lost almost completely and irreversibly over multiple millennia, 
causing several metres of sea level rise (limited evidence). The probability and rate of ice mass loss increase with higher 
global surface temperatures (high confidence). {3.1.2, 3.1.3}
B.3.3	
The probability of low-likelihood outcomes associated with potentially very large impacts increases with higher global 
warming levels (high confidence). Due to deep uncertainty linked to ice-sheet processes, global mean sea level rise 
above the likely range – approaching 2 m by 2100 and in excess of 15 m by 2300 under the very high GHG emissions 
scenario (SSP5-8.5) (low confidence) – cannot be excluded. There is medium confidence that the Atlantic Meridional 
Overturning Circulation will not collapse abruptly before 2100, but if it were to occur, it would very likely cause abrupt 
shifts in regional weather patterns, and large impacts on ecosystems and human activities. {3.1.3} (Box SPM.1)
