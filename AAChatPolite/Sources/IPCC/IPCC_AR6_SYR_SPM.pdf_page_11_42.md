Summary for Policymakers
emissions came from the sectors of energy, industry, transport, and buildings together and 22%10 from agriculture, 
forestry and other land use (AFOLU). Emissions reductions in CO2-FFI due to improvements in energy intensity of GDP 
and carbon intensity of energy, have been less than emissions increases from rising global activity levels in industry, 
energy supply, transport, agriculture and buildings. (high confidence) {2.1.1}
A.1.5	 Historical contributions of CO2 emissions vary substantially across regions in terms of total magnitude, but also in 
terms of contributions to CO2-FFI and net CO2 emissions from land use, land-use change and forestry (CO2-LULUCF). 
In 2019, around 35% of the global population live in countries emitting more than 9 tCO2-eq per capita11 (excluding 
CO2-LULUCF) while 41% live in countries emitting less than 3 tCO2-eq per capita; of the latter a substantial share lacks 
access to modern energy services. Least Developed Countries (LDCs) and Small Island Developing States (SIDS) have 
much lower per capita emissions (1.7 tCO2-eq and 4.6 tCO2-eq, respectively) than the global average (6.9 tCO2-eq), 
excluding CO2-LULUCF. The 10% of households with the highest per capita emissions contribute 34–45% of global 
consumption-based household GHG emissions, while the bottom 50% contribute 13–15%. (high confidence) {2.1.1,

Observed Changes and Impacts
A.2	
Widespread and rapid changes in the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere and biosphere have 
occurred. Human-caused climate change is already affecting many weather and climate 
extremes in every region across the globe. This has led to widespread adverse impacts and 
related losses and damages to nature and people (high confidence). Vulnerable communities 
who have historically contributed the least to current climate change are disproportionately 
affected (high confidence). {2.1, Table 2.1, Figure 2.2, Figure 2.3} (Figure SPM.1)
A.2.1	 It is unequivocal that human influence has warmed the atmosphere, ocean and land. Global mean sea level increased by 
0.20 [0.15 to 0.25] m between 1901 and 2018. The average rate of sea level rise was 1.3 [0.6 to 2.1] mm yr-1 between 1901 
and 1971, increasing to 1.9 [0.8 to 2.9] mm yr-1 between 1971 and 2006, and further increasing to 3.7 [3.2 to 4.2] mm yr-1 
between 2006 and 2018 (high confidence). Human influence was very likely the main driver of these increases since at 
least 1971. Evidence of observed changes in extremes such as heatwaves, heavy precipitation, droughts, and tropical 
cyclones, and, in particular, their attribution to human influence, has further strengthened since AR5. Human influence 
has likely increased the chance of compound extreme events since the 1950s, including increases in the frequency of 
concurrent heatwaves and droughts (high confidence). {2.1.2, Table 2.1, Figure 2.3, Figure 3.4} (Figure SPM.1)
A.2.2	 Approximately 3.3 to 3.6 billion people live in contexts that are highly vulnerable to climate change. Human and 
ecosystem vulnerability are interdependent. Regions and people with considerable development constraints have high 
vulnerability to climatic hazards. Increasing weather and climate extreme events have exposed millions of people 
to acute food insecurity12 and reduced water security, with the largest adverse impacts observed in many locations 
and/or communities in Africa, Asia, Central and South America, LDCs, Small Islands and the Arctic, and globally for 
Indigenous Peoples, small-scale food producers and low-income households. Between 2010 and 2020, human mortality 
from floods, droughts and storms was 15 times higher in highly vulnerable regions, compared to regions with very low 
vulnerability. (high confidence) {2.1.2, 4.4} (Figure SPM.1)
A.2.3	 Climate change has caused substantial damages, and increasingly irreversible losses, in terrestrial, freshwater, 
cryospheric, and coastal and open ocean ecosystems (high confidence). Hundreds of local losses of species have been 
driven by increases in the magnitude of heat extremes (high confidence) with mass mortality events recorded on 
land and in the ocean (very high confidence). Impacts on some ecosystems are approaching irreversibility such as 
the impacts of hydrological changes resulting from the retreat of glaciers, or the changes in some mountain (medium 
confidence) and Arctic ecosystems driven by permafrost thaw (high confidence). {2.1.2, Figure 2.3} (Figure SPM.1)

GHG emission levels are rounded to two significant digits; as a consequence, small differences in sums due to rounding may occur. {2.1.1}

Acute food insecurity can occur at any time with a severity that threatens lives, livelihoods or both, regardless of the causes, context or duration, as a result 
of shocks risking determinants of food security and nutrition, and is used to assess the need for humanitarian action. {2.1}
