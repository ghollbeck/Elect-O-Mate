Adaptation Options and their Limits in a Warmer World
B.4	
Adaptation options that are feasible and effective today will become constrained and 
less effective with increasing global warming. With increasing global warming, losses and 
damages will increase and additional human and natural systems will reach adaptation 
limits. Maladaptation can be avoided by flexible, multi-sectoral, inclusive, long-term 
planning and implementation of adaptation actions, with co-benefits to many sectors and 
systems. (high confidence) {3.2, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3}
B.4.1	
The effectiveness of adaptation, including ecosystem-based and most water-related options, will decrease with 
increasing warming. The feasibility and effectiveness of options increase with integrated, multi-sectoral solutions that 
differentiate responses based on climate risk, cut across systems and address social inequities. As adaptation options 
often have long implementation times, long-term planning increases their efficiency. (high confidence) {3.2, Figure 3.4, 
4.1, 4.2} 
B.4.2	
With additional global warming, limits to adaptation and losses and damages, strongly concentrated among vulnerable 
populations, will become increasingly difficult to avoid (high confidence). Above 1.5°C of global warming, limited 
freshwater resources pose potential hard adaptation limits for small islands and for regions dependent on glacier 
and snow melt (medium confidence). Above that level, ecosystems such as some warm-water coral reefs, coastal 
wetlands, rainforests, and polar and mountain ecosystems will have reached or surpassed hard adaptation limits and as 
a consequence, some Ecosystem-based Adaptation measures will also lose their effectiveness (high confidence). {2.3.2, 
3.2, 4.3}
B.4.3	
Actions that focus on sectors and risks in isolation and on short-term gains often lead to maladaptation over the long 
term, creating lock-ins of vulnerability, exposure and risks that are difficult to change. For example, seawalls effectively 
reduce impacts to people and assets in the short term but can also result in lock-ins and increase exposure to climate 
risks in the long term unless they are integrated into a long-term adaptive plan. Maladaptive responses can worsen 
existing inequities especially for Indigenous Peoples and marginalised groups and decrease ecosystem and biodiversity 
resilience. Maladaptation can be avoided by flexible, multi-sectoral, inclusive, long-term planning and implementation 
of adaptation actions, with co-benefits to many sectors and systems. (high confidence) {2.3.2, 3.2}
Carbon Budgets and Net Zero Emissions
B.5	
Limiting human-caused global warming requires net zero CO2 emissions. Cumulative carbon 
emissions until the time of reaching net zero CO2 emissions and the level of greenhouse 
gas emission reductions this decade largely determine whether warming can be limited to 
1.5°C or 2°C (high confidence). Projected CO2 emissions from existing fossil fuel infrastructure 
without additional abatement would exceed the remaining carbon budget for 1.5°C (50%) 
(high confidence). {2.3, 3.1, 3.3, Table 3.1}
B.5.1	
From a physical science perspective, limiting human-caused global warming to a specific level requires limiting cumulative 
CO2 emissions, reaching at least net zero CO2 emissions, along with strong reductions in other greenhouse gas emissions. 
Reaching net zero GHG emissions primarily requires deep reductions in CO2, methane, and other GHG emissions, and 
implies net negative CO2 emissions39. Carbon dioxide removal (CDR) will be necessary to achieve net negative CO2 
emissions (see B.6). Net zero GHG emissions, if sustained, are projected to result in a gradual decline in global surface 
temperatures after an earlier peak. (high confidence) {3.1.1, 3.3.1, 3.3.2, 3.3.3, Table 3.1, Cross-Section Box.1}
B.5.2	
For every 1000 GtCO2 emitted by human activity, global surface temperature rises by 0.45°C (best estimate, with a likely 
range from 0.27°C to 0.63°C). The best estimates of the remaining carbon budgets from the beginning of 2020 are 
500 GtCO2 for a 50% likelihood of limiting global warming to 1.5°C and 1150 GtCO2 for a 67% likelihood of limiting 
warming to 2°C40. The stronger the reductions in non-CO2 emissions, the lower the resulting temperatures are for a given 
remaining carbon budget or the larger remaining carbon budget for the same level of temperature change41. {3.3.1}

Global databases make different choices about which emissions and removals occurring on land are considered anthropogenic. Most countries report their 
anthropogenic land CO2 fluxes including fluxes due to human-caused environmental change (e.g., CO2 fertilisation) on ‘managed’ land in their national 
GHG inventories. Using emissions estimates based on these inventories, the remaining carbon budgets must be correspondingly reduced. {3.3.1}
41	
For example, remaining carbon budgets could be 300 or 600 GtCO2 for 1.5°C (50%), respectively for high and low non-CO2 emissions, compared to 
500 GtCO2 in the central case. {3.3.1}
