* See footnote 21 for the SSPx-y terminology. 
** See footnote 23 for the RCPy terminology.
*** Limited overshoot refers to exceeding 1.5°C global warming by up to about 0.1°C, high overshoot by 0.1°C-0.3°C, in both 
cases for up to several decades.
Current Mitigation Progress, Gaps and Challenges
A.4	
Policies and laws addressing mitigation have consistently expanded since AR5. Global GHG 
emissions in 2030 implied by nationally determined contributions (NDCs) announced by October 
2021 make it likely that warming will exceed 1.5°C during the 21st century and make it harder 
to limit warming below 2°C. There are gaps between projected emissions from implemented 
policies and those from NDCs and finance flows fall short of the levels needed to meet climate 
goals across all sectors and regions. (high confidence) {2.2, 2.3, Figure 2.5, Table 2.2}
A.4.1	 The UNFCCC, Kyoto Protocol, and the Paris Agreement are supporting rising levels of national ambition. The Paris Agreement, 
adopted under the UNFCCC, with near universal participation, has led to policy development and target-setting at national 
and sub-national levels, in particular in relation to mitigation, as well as enhanced transparency of climate action and 
support (medium confidence). Many regulatory and economic instruments have already been deployed successfully 
(high confidence). In many countries, policies have enhanced energy efficiency, reduced rates of deforestation and 
accelerated technology deployment, leading to avoided and in some cases reduced or removed emissions (high 
confidence). Multiple lines of evidence suggest that mitigation policies have led to several24 Gt CO2-eq yr-1 of avoided 
global emissions (medium confidence). At least 18 countries have sustained absolute production-based GHG and 
consumption-based CO2 reductions25 for longer than 10 years. These reductions have only partly offset global emissions 
growth (high confidence). {2.2.1, 2.2.2}
A.4.2	 Several mitigation options, notably solar energy, wind energy, electrification of urban systems, urban green infrastructure, 
energy efficiency, demand-side management, improved forest and crop/grassland management, and reduced food 
waste and loss, are technically viable, are becoming increasingly cost effective and are generally supported by the 
24	
At least 1.8 GtCO2-eq yr–1 can be accounted for by aggregating separate estimates for the effects of economic and regulatory instruments. Growing 
numbers of laws and executive orders have impacted global emissions and were estimated to result in 5.9 GtCO2-eq yr–1 less emissions in 2016 than they 
otherwise would have been. (medium confidence) {2.2.2}

Reductions were linked to energy supply decarbonisation, energy efficiency gains, and energy demand reduction, which resulted from both policies and 
changes in economic structure (high confidence). {2.2.2}
