Figure SPM.1: (a) Climate change has already caused widespread impacts and related losses and damages on human systems and altered terrestrial, 
freshwater and ocean ecosystems worldwide. Physical water availability includes balance of water available from various sources including ground water, water 
quality and demand for water. Global mental health and displacement assessments reflect only assessed regions. Confidence levels reflect the assessment of 
attribution of the observed impact to climate change. (b) Observed impacts are connected to physical climate changes including many that have been attributed 
to human influence such as the selected climatic impact-drivers shown. Confidence and likelihood levels reflect the assessment of attribution of the observed 
climatic impact-driver to human influence. (c) Observed (1900–2020) and projected (2021–2100) changes in global surface temperature (relative to 1850-1900), 
which are linked to changes in climate conditions and impacts, illustrate how the climate has already changed and will change along the lifespan of three
